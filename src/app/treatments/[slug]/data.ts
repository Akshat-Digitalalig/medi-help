			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy Surgery in India-A complete Patient’s guide</span></h2>
<p>Thyroid cancer has become extremely common these days. With the increase in the number of cases and advancement in medical science, new surgical techniques have been developed for the treatment of cancer. People suffering from benign thyroid tumours and thyroid cancer can now take a sigh of relief with the development of <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy Sugery in India</strong>.</p>
<p>Robotic Thyroidectomy is a special surgical procedure where surgery is performed with the help of a robot. The robot receives the instructions from the surgeon and then puts them into action. The surgery has proved to be a boon for cancer patients who do not want any visible scar in the neck region after the surgery. In the robotic procedure, there are no visible scars because the thyroid region is accessed using an underarm incision. The results of <strong>robotic thyroidectomy surgery in Delhi</strong> are more aesthetically pleasing than conventional thyroid surgery.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the surgical treatment options available for thyroid cancer in India?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Surgery is the removal of the tumour surrounding the healthy tissue. It is the main treatment for people suffering from thyroid cancer. An oncologist decides the type of surgical option that would best suit the patient depending on the size and stage of the thyroid nodule. The common surgical options are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lobectomy:</strong></span> In this surgery, a lobe of the thyroid gland is removed that has a cancerous nodule inside.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Near Total Thyroidectomy:</strong> </span>It is also called subtotal thyroidectomy in which most of the thyroid gland is removed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Total Thyroidectomy:</strong></span> This surgery involves the removal of the entire thyroid gland.</p>
<p>Different surgical approaches used for <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy in India</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The different surgical techniques used in India are:</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Traditional Thyroidectomy:</strong></span> It is a standard technique in which the surgeon cuts through the middle of the base of the neck. The cut gives access to the thyroid gland from where the surgeon removed the cancerous nodules.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Endoscopic Thyroidectomy:</strong></span> The surgery is quite similar to conventional thyroidectomy except for a scope with a video monitor inserted to give a clear magnification of the thyroid gland. In this surgery, the surgeon makes a single small incision.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic Thyroidectomy:</strong> </span>It is the most effective surgical technique performed in India to treat thyroid cancers. In this, the incision is made in the armpit, or behind the ear or through orally to access the thyroid gland. The surgeon then uses a robot to perform the surgery. However, the robot operates on the commands of the surgeon. This is the most widely used surgical technique these days as it involves no scarring and gives the best results.</p>
<p>The best surgical option and technique will be decided by your surgeon depending on the type of cancer you have. It is better to learn about the results and recovery time for each procedure before the surgery to select the best possible treatment option for yourself. Robotic Thyroidectomy is the latest technology that has brought exceptional results in the field of cancer treatment. If you want no scarring after the surgery and want minimum recovery time, it is just the right procedure for you. Continue reading to know more about it.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Where is Robotic Thyroidectomy needed?</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy in India</strong> may be recommended to patients who suffer from various thyroid diseases that require the removal of the thyroid gland. These diseases include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benign Thyroid Nodules:</strong></span> These nodules are non-cancerous, However, their removal is necessary because they cause difficulty in swallowing and breathing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Papillary Thyroid Cancer:</strong> </span>This is the most common type of thyroid cancer. It requires surgical removal of the thyroid tissue.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Follicular Thyroid Cancer:</strong></span> This type of thyroid cancer is comparatively less common as compared to papillary cancer, but its treatment also involves the removal of the thyroid gland.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Multinodular goiter:</strong></span> It is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and develops multiple nodules. Its surgery also requires the removal of thyroid tissue</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hurthle cell Carcinoma:</strong></span> It is the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer which involves the removal of the entire thyroid gland.</p>
<p>Robotic <strong>Thyroidectomy surgery in India</strong> adds a new dimension to thyroid surgery which gives patients an option to have a scarless cancer surgery. Besides it, the use of robots allows surgeons to have a detailed look at the thyroid which enables them to perform the surgery with dexterity.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The latest treatment for Scarless Thyroidectomy in India:</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Types of robotic Thyroidectomy</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>RABIT:</strong></span> RABIT stands for Robotic-assisted breast-axilla insufflation thyroidectomy. It is a novel thyroid removal procedure invented by Dr Sandeep Nayak, a renowned oncologist in India. It is a more refined form of <strong>robotic thyroidectomy surgery in Delhi,</strong> which uses sophisticated Da Vinci Robotic devices to keep the wound small. It uses a single docking technique which enables the doctors to access both the lymph nodes and lobes when required. In this technique, the scar is hardly noticeable, as it is only 0.8 to 2 cm long, unlike conventional procedures that leave a visible 7 to 10 cm long scar in the neck region which ultimately deteriorates the confidence of the patients. Above all, this procedure is less complicated than traditional surgical methods.</p>
<p>TORS: TORS stands for Transoral Robotic Surgery. It is an effective option for people dealing with early oropharyngeal cancers. The main advantages of<strong> transoral robotic thyroidectomy</strong> include easy visualisation of the thyroid gland, superior manoeuvrability, safe dissections around the vital organs and it also enabled the patients to regain their normal functions quite quickly In this procedure, a small and flexible endoscope is inserted into the mouth and then into the throat. The surgeon then uses the robotic arms to perform precise surgical movements. It is a minimally invasive technique that involves less blood loss, reduced pain and faster recovery.</p>
<p>Retroauricular approach: It is also a minimally invasive approach in which the incision is made behind the ear to remove the thyroid gland. It is a safe and effective approach as compared to other traditional surgeries. With smaller incisions and less tissue trauma, patients can recover faster and have reduced pain, allowing them to go back to work faster. Some patients aren’t good candidates for this approach, so it’s best to consult with a qualified surgeon before deciding whether to proceed or not.</p>
<p>Unleashing the power of Robotics-A step by step guide for <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy Surgery In India</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before surgery:</strong></span> Before undergoing robotic thyroidectomy, your healthcare provider may recommend you the following things:</p>
<p>A CT scan or a thyroid ultrasound to know where the abnormal thyroid growth.<br>
A biopsy of the nodule to know whether it is cancerous or non-cancerous<br>
A thyroid medicine to stop the overproduction of thyroid hormones before two weeks<br>
Quit smoking or drinking as it increases complications during the surgery and reduces the healing time.<br>
It is very important to inform your surgeon about the medications you are on. If you are taking any prescription or nonprescription medicine, make sure to ask your doctor if you can take them before the surgical procedure. You may also be asked to stop the blood thinners if you are on them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During surgery:</strong></span> <strong>Robotic Thyroidectomy</strong> is performed using the da Vinci Surgical System. The system has:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Four Robotic Hands:</strong></span> These hands are called EndoWrist instruments and they work just like hands. They can grab things, twist and turn and allow surgeons to make precise movements.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>3D camera:</strong> </span>It is an HD camera that gives a 3D image of the thyroid. The surgeon can zoom the image to get a clear view of the thyroid gland using this camera.</p>
<p><strong>Console:</strong> The surgeon performing the surgery sits on the console to control the robotic hands while seeing the images on the camera.</p>
<p>The robotic hands and the camera are inserted via incisions. The thyroid gland is then removed by the surgeon depending on the type of cancer the patient has. The complete system is under the control of the surgeon as the robotic hands cannot move on their own. They perform the movements instructed by the surgeon and the doctors give inputs to the da Vinci system based on the decisions they make during the surgery. The incision made during the surgery is very small, thus making robotic thyroidectomy incredibly popular among people suffering from thyroid cancer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After Surgery:</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Follow-up &amp; Recovery:</strong> </span>The follow-up and recovery after <strong>thyroid cancer treatment in India</strong> involve several stages.</p>
<p>You will be shifted to the recovery room where your vitals will be monitored as you may feel nauseated from the anaesthesia.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcomes of the<strong> robotic thyroidectomy surgery in Delhi</strong>, the doctor will decide how many days you have to stay in the hospital. During your hospital stay you will be under close observation to avoid any complications.</p>
<p>It is normal to experience pain and discomfort after the surgery, but it can be easily managed with pain medications.You have to keep the incision site clean and dry to prevent any type of infection.<br>
It is better to avoid strenuous physical activities and keep the wound time to heal.<br>
It is important to have regular follow-ups with your surgeon to monitor the progress and make sure that your body is healing perfectly.<br>
Depending on the extent of surgery, ie, partial or complete removal of the thyroid gland, you may be recommended voice rest to give your vocal cords time to heal.<br>
If your entire thyroid gland is removed, you will need to take thyroid replacement hu medication for your entire life. However, the medication will be decided by your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Precautionary Measures-Essential steps to reduce the risk after the <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy in India</strong></p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will inform you of how to care for the incision site, what medications to take, and when to resume normal activities. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth recovery.<br>
To allow your body to heal, you should rest and avoid strenuous activity after surgery. Do not lift heavy objects or exercise strenuously.<br>
Keep the incision site dry and clean to reduce infection risks. The wound care instructions will be provided by your healthcare provider.<br>
Look for signs of infection at the incision site, including redness, swelling, or pus. If any of these symptoms occur, contact your healthcare provider.<br>
If you experience pain after surgery, take the pain medication prescribed by your healthcare provider. Medications reduce complications and relieve pain.<br>
You may have hoarseness or a change in voice after surgery. You may need voice rest for some time to allow your vocal cords to heal.<br>
If your entire thyroid gland has been removed, you’ll need thyroid hormone replacement medication forever. Monitor your thyroid hormone levels and adjust your medication if necessary.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic Thyroidectomy</strong></span></h2>
<p>The following are the advantages of robotic <strong>thyroidectomy&nbsp; surgery in India</strong> over conventional thyroid surgeries:</p>
<p>No Incision in the Neck ( Cosmetically Compliant Surgery) Unlike traditional thyroid surgeries, the incision is not made in the neck. Very small incisions are made in the underarm or behind the ear. These incisions are very small and hardly visible. Thus robotic thyroidectomy gives better aesthetic outcomes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>3D View:</strong></span> In traditional surgery, it is only possible to see the thyroid gland from top to bottom. However, using the robotic procedure, the 3D camera gives a magnified view of the thyroid gland which enables surgeons to have a closer look.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Identification of critical structures:</strong></span> Since the 3D camera used in the surgery gives a magnified view, it enables surgeons to see the critical structures of the thyroid gland like the laryngeal nerve and parathyroid glands.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Less Blood Loss:</strong></span> <strong>Robotic Thyroidectomy</strong> is done using small incisions, therefore the blood loss is minimum as compared to the conventional approach.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Dexterity:</strong></span> The robotic hands used during the surgery gives surgeons the freedom to manipulate certain regions of the thyroid gland easily.</p>
<p>Clinical Results (Conventional vs Robotic)</p>
<p>If we compare the clinical results of both robotic thyroidectomy and conventional thyroidectomy, then the results are in favour of the robotic procedure due to the following <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>reasons:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Reduced postoperative pain:</strong></span> People who undergo robotic thyroidectomy experience less pain and thus have fewer pain medications compared to people who choose the traditional surgical technique.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Shorter Hospital Stays:</strong></span> Hospital stays are shorter with robotic thyroidectomy as there is less tissue damage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Better cosmetic outcomes:</strong></span>&nbsp; S<strong>carless Robotic Thyroidectomy Surgery</strong> gives better cosmetic outcomes as the incisions made are extremely small and are hardly visible.</p>

<h2><b>Diseases of Prostate: Knowing types of prostate problems men deal with</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostate diseases include various conditions that affect the prostate gland. The diseases include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prostate Cancer: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a type of cancer that develops in the prostate gland. It is a life-threatening cancer that requires immediate medical attention. Its symptoms include difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, pain in the pelvis, and, above all, erectile dysfunction. The most effective way to treat prostate cancer nowadays is </span><b>nerve-sparing robotic prostatectomy.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prostatitis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a disease that causes inflammation of the prostate gland and is caused by harmful bacteria. Its symptoms include pain and discomfort in the prostate area and also cause difficulty in urinating sometimes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that occurs with age. Its symptoms include difficulty holding urine in the bladder, weak urine flow, frequent urination, and </span><b>a </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Robotic Prostatectomy in India: Where is it needed?</b></h2>
<p><b>Robotic Prostatectomy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a surgical procedure that is used to remove the prostate gland in men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. This procedure is more suitable for people who are in an early stage of cancer and cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. It is also an appropriate option for people who have failed other treatments like chemotherapy or hormone therapy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the most effective treatment option for some specific types and stages of prostate cancer. However, during </span><b>prostate cancer treatment in India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the decision to undergo a robotic prostatectomy depends on a case-to-case basis, and only an experienced healthcare professional can suggest which treatment option is best for you.</span></p>
<p><b>Nerve Sparing Technique</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nerve-sparing technique is a crucial aspect of robotic prostatectomy. This technique focuses on preserving neurovascular bundles that control erectile function and urinary continence. By using robotic surgery, surgeons can avoid damaging these vital nerves, leading to better postoperative sexual outcomes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Thinking Out Of the Box-Alternative Treatment for Prostate Cancer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgery is one of the most common treatments for </span><b>prostate cancer.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The primary goal of surgery is to remove the cancerous tissue from the prostate gland and leave as much healthy tissue as possible. Besides </span><b>robotic prostatectomy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the other surgical options available for prostate cancer are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Open radical prostatectomy: Open radical prostatectom</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">y is a traditional procedure that involves making one large incision in the abdomen or perineum (between the scrotum and anus) to remove the prostate gland. Patients with large tumors or advanced prostate cancer may benefit from this procedure.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a minimally invasive surgery that removes the prostate gland through multiple small incisions in the abdomen. In India, Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Surgery is guided by a laparoscope (a thin tube with a camera and light).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Transurethral prostate resection (TURP):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a surgery that removes part of the prostate gland through the urethra. This procedure may be recommended for patients with early-stage prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) experiencing urinary symptoms.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>The Future of Prostate Cancer Treatment in India The Procedure of Robotic Prostatectomy in India</b></h2>
<p><b>Before the Surgery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several steps that a patient has to go through before the </span><b>scarless robotic prostatectomy surgery in India. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These steps ensure the patient is healthy enough for the surgery. It includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgeon will first go through the medical history of the patient and will also do a physical examination in which he examines the prostate gland of the patient by inserting a lubricant into the rectum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood tests are performed to check kidney function and blood cell counts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imaging tests like MRI and CT scans are ordered to determine the extent of the cancer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the patient meets with the Surgeon before the surgery. It’s an opportunity for the patient to ask questions, discuss concerns, and discover what to expect before, during, and after the surgery. The Surgeon will also review the patient’s medical history and test results to ensure he’s a good candidate for the surgery.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>During the Procedure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During</span><b> Nerve Sparing Robotic Prostatectomy in India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, six keyhole incisions are made in the abdomen through which trocars are placed to allow the instruments into the abdomen.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abdomen is then filled with carbon dioxide gas for the operation. At the end of the operation, this gas is removed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgeon controls the robotic instruments ( da Vinci Robotic System) to perform dissection, cutting, and suturing with dexterity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgeon controls the lens connected to an HD camera, which provides a 3D view of the prostate to the Surgeon.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prostate is detached from the bladder and urethra, preserving the surrounding nerve tissues. The</span><b> nerve-sparing technique</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preserves the patient’s ability to achieve spontaneous erections after recovery from the surgery.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, the bladder is sewn back to the urethra to restore the continuity of the urinary tract.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recovery and Follow-Up After the procedure- Keep things in mind.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be taken to a recovery area to wake up from anesthesia and be monitored after surgery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drain urine from the bladder, a catheter will be placed, and medication will be given to manage pain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It usually takes one to two days in the hospital, but it could take longer if a lot is going on.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you become more active and mobile, you will begin with shorter walks around the hospital.</span></li>

<h2><b>Pinning Down the Advantages of Robotic Prostatectomy in India</b></h2>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary advantages of robotic prostatectomy are:</span></p>
<p><b>Preservation of Sexual Function: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">By sparing the neurovascular bundles, the procedure significantly reduces the risk of erectile dysfunction post-surgery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><b>Less invasive</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Robotic prostatectomy causes less blood loss and damage to surrounding tissues than open surgery. As a result, patients can recover quicker and suffer less pain.</span></p>
<p><b>Precision</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Robotic surgery allows for high levels of precision, which is especially important in delicate procedures like prostatectomy. With robotic instruments, surgery can be performed more precisely and accurately.</span></p>
<p><b>Risk of complications is reduced: Robotic prostatectomy surgery in Delh</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">i is minimally invasive, reducing infections, bleeding, and blood clots. In addition, robotic instruments can reduce nerve damage and other complications associated with open surgery.</span></p>
<p><b>Shorter hospital stays</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Patients who undergo robotic surgery have comparatively shorter hospital stays than people who undergo traditional surgery.</span></p>
<p><b>Faster recovery time</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Since robotic prostatectomy is a minimally invasive procedure, the recovery time is faster than traditional methods of removing the prostate gland via surgery.</span></p>

    <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is The Cost of Robotic Sleep Apnea Surgery in India?&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">On average, the <strong>cost of robotic sleep apnea surgery in India</strong> would range somewhere around <strong><span style="color: #000000;">4500 USD to 5000 USD</span></strong> in top-notch JCI-accredited hospitals.</p>

			<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;">Trans-oral Robotic Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in India&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a health disorder, characterized by patients who display snoring accompanied by irregular breathing patterns while being asleep. The main cause of OSA is the ’obstruction in throat muscles’ – they are normally in a relaxed state but tend to fall backwards during sleep – hence the disease is referred to as obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. It affects 22% of men and 17% of women globally, especially middle-aged overweight adults.</p>
<p>Here we will discuss the best <strong>treatment for sleep apnea in India</strong> and we will also let you know how Medihelp Global  will help you.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Which all potential health hazards can OSA cause?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If left untreated, OSA could tremendously affect quality of life due to a lack of sound sleep. It may further lead to stroke, heart attack, diabetes, sexual disorder, stress and irritability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When should one consult a doctor?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many patients believe that snoring is not related to any illness and is a normal phenomenon; however one should seek consultation from a specialist doctor when:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Snoring starts to interrupt in getting a sound sleep for themselves and others around.</li>
<li>Shortness of breath leads to off-and-on sleep, leading to irregular sleeping patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What treatment options are available to cure sleep apnea in India?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Proper diagnosis of sleep apnea and identification of its cause is the key before treating any sleep apnea patient. Two types of <strong>sleep apnea treatment</strong> options are available:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Non-surgical treatments include:</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Sleeping on either side to minimize throat muscle obstruction</li>
<li>Following a proper sleeping pattern religiously and getting adequate sleep – this could eventually help in reducing episodes of sleep apnea</li>
<li>Saying goodbye to alcohol right before sleeping time – this helps in increasing airway passage</li>
<li>Regularly exercising – this could help reduce weight and prove beneficial in mild and moderate sleep apnea cases. It is an effective way for treatment of<strong> Obstructive Sleep Apnea in India</strong></li>
<li>Quitting smoking as smoking leads to swelling the throat that could cause obstruction</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Control positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask: </strong></span>This is the most advised treatment option for treating sleep apnea. CPAP mask allows pressurized air to pass through the nose into the airways, thus helping in prevention of obstruction that could happen due to lack of enough oxygen while sleeping. This mask is connected to the device that is supposed to be placed near bedside where patient sleeps – this device helps in pumping the pressurized air. Although it is a non-invasive treatment, but still most patient find it difficult to sleep with the CPAP mask on and are hence unable to comply with it most of the time. Treatment options for such patients include weight reduction, use of oral devices and surgery.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is Trans-Oral Robotic Surgery In India?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Trans-oral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for obstructive sleep apnea in India</strong> is a highly advanced, minimally invasive surgical option for the treatment of OSA. As part of this surgery, to reduce obstruction, the surgeon reduces the base of the tongue through the oral cavity using da Vinci robot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is considered as a safe, highly precise surgical treatment option for patients, without having them to suffer serious complications with excellent clinical results that help in improving the quality of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to eliminating the existing obstruction in the mouth, throat and nose, the da Vinci robot also empowers the <strong>TORS surgeons</strong> to perform surgery even in the deeper areas of the oral cavity. One of the major benefits in such type of robotic surgery is that it can be customized according to the patient’s need and anatomy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What should I know before I think of undergoing TORS?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start with, the surgeon recommends the patient to undergo the sleep study test. To prepare for this test, the patient is required at get admitted in the special sleep lab for a day. The patient is being monitored by a specialist who operates the video camera to observe and record the sleeping patterns and any visible shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is another alternative test namely ‘sleep endoscopy’ for those who don’t want to wear the CPAP mask during the sleep study. In this procedure, the patient will be given a medicine for sleep. While the patient is still asleep, an endoscope is inserted in the nose and throat to see the site better and understand the extent of obstruction caused to plan and prepare for the robotic surgery. These tests will enable surgeons to identify the needs of <strong>Trans-Oral Robotic Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in India</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery and Post Operative Care</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Robotic sleep apnea surgery in Delhi</strong> typically requires a hospital stay of one or two nights for monitoring and recovery. Medical staff will assess your condition and provide appropriate care during this time.</li>
<li>Your surgical site may be sore or uncomfortable. If you have postoperative pain, your surgeon will prescribe pain medication.</li>
<li>Keep any incisions clean and dry to prevent infection. Follow your surgeon’s instructions on wound care, including when to change dressings.</li>
<li>Rest and activity are crucial during recovery. It would help if you avoided strenuous activities, but your surgeon may recommend gentle movements and short walks to promote circulation.</li>
<li>You may be prescribed medications to manage pain or prevent infection. You should take all medications as your surgeon directs and discuss any side effects.</li>
<li>Make sure you attend all your surgeon’s follow-up appointments after <strong>Robotic Sleep Apnea Surgery in India</strong>. You should attend these appointments to monitor your progress, have any sutures removed, and address any concerns.</li>

This is a minimally invasive surgery used to treat lung cancer by removing diseased tissue using the latest Da Vinci Xi Surgical Robot. Let’s learn more about affordable lung cancer treatment options&nbsp; in India.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is the Indication for Robotic Lung Cancer Surgery?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">If detected at early stage the best way to eradicate lung cancer is robotic lung cancer surgery. And it is used worldwide as standard care of treatment.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Key Advantages of Robotic Lung Cancer Surgery</span></strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimal Invasive with complete automation:</strong> </span><strong>Surgery for lung cancer</strong> if carried out through high end surgical robots provides magnified 3D view and wristed instruments of robots allow surgeons to make precise, controlled movements, without having to make larger incisions in the ribs. This allows surgeon to remove entire tumor mass present in the thoracic cavity (chest). Other advantages include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><strong>Faster recovery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Less change of infection post surgery</strong></li>
<li><strong>Early discharge</strong></li>
<li><strong>Surgical outcome is unmatched</strong></li>
<li><strong>Less bleeding as compared to open surgery</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Surgical Outcome of Lung Cancer Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robotic surgeries for lung cancer can eradiate lung cancer completely with its 3D camera which gives surgeon 360° magnifying view in order to remove each and every tumor cell. The patient can live a normal life after <strong>lung cancer treatment in India</strong>.&nbsp; These sophisticated robotic systems are new and gives maximum benefits to the patients.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is the Post op Recovery?</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Robotic thoracic surgeries are minimal invasive, surgeon goes inside the chest cavity with a very tiny cut hence recovery is very fast. Patient can go home after 4-5 days after surgery without much discomfort.</p>

			<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Robotic CABG Surgery in India: The Future Of Heart Surgeries</span> </strong></h2>
<p>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves blood flow to the heart for patients with blocked arteries. The <strong>robotic CABG surgery</strong> is a relatively new minimally invasive surgical technique. It’s less invasive than conventional open heart surgery, which involves sawing the breastbone in half. It uses surgical robots and a camera attached to a robotic machine, which the heart surgeon controls via a computer console. This minimally invasive technique allows precise control of the surgical instruments through minor cuts (4 to 6 cm) on the side of the chest.</p>
<p>Only skilled surgeons can perform this surgical procedure. Here we will delve into the details of<strong> robotic CABG surgery</strong> and how it is performed in India. We will also inform you about India’s best hospitals and doctors performing this surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Like all body organs, the heart also needs a constant blood supply. The blood is supplied via two large blood vessels, the left and right coronary arteries. However, these arteries become narrow and hardened over time by depositing fatty acids known as plaques. This is known as atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>People suffering from this disease are said to have coronary heart disease. The best treatment option in India to treat coronary heart disease is <strong>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting,</strong> also known as<strong> CABG.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding CABG</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, commonly known as CABG, is a surgical procedure performed to improve the blood flow to the heart.</li>
<li>A healthy blood vessel is taken from the leg or chest to bypass the blocked artery.</li>
<li>It is a well-established procedure successfully performed in India to treat CAD for years.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The Emergence of Robotic CABG Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robotic CABG</strong> uses specialized instruments and a 3D camera for high-definition imaging.</li>
<li>Using robotic arms, the surgeon can access the heart through small incisions in the patient’s chest.</li>
<li>A surgeon sits at a console near the operating table and controls the robotic arms with his hands and feet.</li>
<li>A robotic system translates a surgeon’s movement into precise actions, allowing the bypass vessel to graft onto the affected coronary arteries.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How likely are you to get Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Coronary heart disease is more likely to happen as you get older. You can also get it if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re a smoker</li>
<li>Your weight is out of control</li>
<li>Your diet is high in fat</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the common symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Coronary artery disease symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain in your chest</li>
<li>Tiredness on exertion</li>
<li>Feeling palpitations</li>
<li>An abnormal heartbeat</li>
<li>Breathlessness on exertion</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Coronary Artery Bypass surgery: Who needs it?</strong></span></p>
<p>A&nbsp; <strong>robotic CABG surgery in India</strong> restores blood flow around a blocked artery. Surgery is an emergency treatment for a heart attack. In these situations, it may also be recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blockage in the left artery is preventing your heart from getting enough blood</li>
<li>Severe narrowing in the central heart artery</li>
<li>A chest pain that’s unbearable</li>
<li>Blockage of more than one artery in the heart</li>
<li>Blockage of a heart artery that can’t be fixed with angioplasty</li>
<li>Angioplasty that didn’t work, with or without a stent.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis </strong></span></p>
<p>You can get the following tests before surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrocardiogram or ECG</li>
<li>A heart ultrasound</li>
<li>Stress Echo</li>
<li>Nuclear cardiac stress test</li>
<li>Angiography</li>
<li>Cardiac CT scan</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic CABG Surgery in Delhi: Understanding the Surgery in Detail</strong></span></h2>
<p>This is the latest treatment option available in India for treating patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Unlike traditional CABG, it is a specialized coronary artery bypass technique that uses robots to perform the surgery. Let us understand this surgery in detail.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>To decide if this procedure is correct, your healthcare provider will examine your medical history, lifestyle, and the severity of your condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions to your healthcare provider about the procedure.</li>
<li>During the procedure, you must sign a consent form. Be bold and ask questions if something needs to be clarified.</li>
<li>Your healthcare provider will do a physical exam and a medical history to ensure your health. Blood tests and other diagnostic tests may also be done.</li>
<li>Tell your healthcare provider if you’re pregnant.</li>
<li>Ensure your healthcare provider knows if you’re sensitive to or allergic to medicines, latex, iodine, tape, contrast dyes, or anaesthetics.</li>
<li>Ensure your doctor knows what you’re taking (prescriptions, over-the-counter, herbal supplements).</li>
<li>You should tell your healthcare provider if you have a bleeding disorder or if you take anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medicine or aspirin. You may have to stop these medicines before the procedure.</li>
<li>You should tell your healthcare provider if you have a pacemaker.</li>
<li>Before the <strong>robotic coronary artery bypass surgery in India</strong>, stop smoking if you smoke. It’ll help you recover from surgery and stay healthy.</li>
<li>After midnight, you can’t eat, drink, or take oral medicine for 8 hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>The doctor may ask you to do other preparations based on your medical condition.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Procedure</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Anesthesia: </strong></span>Before the <strong>Robotic CABG</strong> surgery, the patient is put under general anesthesia to keep them asleep and pain-free.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgical Setup:</strong></span> The patient is positioned on an operating table, and tiny incisions are made in the chest. Robotic instruments enter through these small incisions.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Setup of the robotic system</strong></span>: The surgical team sets up the robot, usually the da Vinci Surgical System, which consists of a high-definition 3D camera and robotic arms.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgeon Console</strong>:</span> Cardiothoracic surgeons sit at a console near the operating table, controlling robotic arms with their hands and feet. The robotic system turns the surgeon’s movements into precise actions.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Placement of trocars:</strong></span> Trocars are hollow tubes inserted through small incisions. The trocars are used to get the robotic arms into the patient.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Identifying a Bypass Vessel:</strong> </span>The surgeon will choose a healthy blood vessel for the bypass graft, usually from the leg or chest. Grafts are carefully harvested and prepared.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Exposed Coronary Artery</strong>:</span> The surgeon exposes the heart’s narrowed or blocked coronary artery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Grafting the Bypass Vessel:</strong> </span>The surgeon uses robots to attach one end of the bypass vessel to the aorta and the other to the coronary artery beyond the blockage. It bypasses the blocked or narrowed area and restores normal blood flow to the heart.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Verification and Quality Check:</strong></span> After the bypass graft during <span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;<strong>robotic coronary artery bypass surgery in Delhi</strong></span>, the surgeons ensure nothing leaks.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Closure:</strong></span> The robotic instruments are removed once the procedure is complete, and the small incisions are closed with sutures or surgical glue.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is a graft? Which one is better, venous or arterial? </strong></span></p>
<p>A graft is a blood vessel used to bypass a blocked artery. The most common types of CABG grafts are arterial and venous grafts. Here is a comparison between the two:</p>

</table>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After The Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll be moved to the CTVS ICU as soon as the surgery is done.</li>
<li>As soon as your pain is under control, you can keep liquid down without nausea and vomiting, and your labs look normal or close to the baseline, you’ll be discharged.</li>
<li>After you get discharged from the hospital, you can manage your pain with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</li>
<li>Keep your incisions clean and dry. Do not use powders, or lotions, on the incision lines, as this can irritate the skin.</li>
<li>After <strong>robotic CABG surgery</strong>, you can return to regular activity more quickly. In most cases, you’ll be able to get back to your routine after a few weeks.</li>
<li>You’ll usually have follow-up appointments with your doctor. Tell your healthcare provider immediately if you experience chest pain or discomfort after the procedure.</li>
<li>Remember to take all or your medicines as prescribed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic CABG</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Scarring and postoperative pain are reduced with smaller incisions.</li>
<li>Shorter hospital stays and faster recovery are possible with minimal chest trauma.</li>
<li>Surgery can be more precise with high-definition 3D cameras.</li>
<li>The risk of infection and complications is lower than with open-heart surgery.</li>
<li>Patients get discharged after 5 days of surgery</li>
<li>There will be no post-surgical anaemia due to less blood loss during surgery</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks in Robotic CABG</strong></span></p>
<p>Despite the numerous benefits of robotic surgery, there are still risks to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are small risks of bleeding, wound infections, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, strokes, and death or the need for further operation in the future<strong>. </strong></li>
<li>Risks vary among individuals depending on the severity of the underlying disease.</li>
<li>You should discuss the risks and benefits with your surgeon before the surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Outcomes and Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Robotic CABG&nbsp; surgery in India</strong> has shown promising results compared to traditional CABG. Despite a lack of long-term data, initial studies suggest that Robotic CABG is a safe, effective, and open surgery<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What’s next?</strong></span></p>
<p>Robotic CABG is only going to get better as technology gets better. We could see advancements in robotic platforms, the integration of artificial intelligence, and the expansion of robotic-assisted cardiac procedures.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Limitations of Robotic Surgery </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>A robotic system can be costly, making it a substantial investment for healthcare facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Robotic CABG</strong> requires specialized training for surgeons to master the technology</li>
<li>Rural and less developed areas may not have access to robotic CABG</li>
<li>Not all patients are suitable candidates for robotic CABG, especially obese patients.</li>
<li>Various types of coronary artery disease and valve conditions may not be suitable for robotic CABG.</li>
<li>It may take longer to complete robotic CABG compared to traditional CABG.</li>
<li>&nbsp;The success of R<strong>obotic CABG surgery in Delhi</strong> depends on the robotic system and associated technology. Mistakes or system failures could affect the surgery.</li>

<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis: </strong></span>&nbsp;It is an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks hip joints, leading to inflammation. In such circumstances, hip replacement becomes necessary to restore the function of the hips.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hip Fractures: </strong></span>A severe hip fracture can significantly impair the stability and function of hip joints. In such cases, hip replacement is required to repair the fractured bone and restore mobility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></span>&nbsp;is the most common cause of <strong>hip replacement surgery in India</strong>. It occurs when the cartilage that cushions the hip joint wears away, thus, leading to joint pain, stiffness and reduced mobility<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hip Dysplasia: </strong></span>It is a condition in which the hip joint does not develop properly. It leads to pain, instability and degeneration of the hip joint. In such cases, hip replacement becomes necessary to correct the abnormal hip structure<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Avascular Necrosis: </strong></span>This condition occurs when the blood supply to the hip joint gets disrupted which causes death of the bone tissue. This leads to deterioration of the hip joint which causes pain and limited mobility. In such cases, a hip replacement surgery can help.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Different Surgical options available for Hip Replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;Hip replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>, also known as hip arthroplasty is a procedure where the damaged hip joint is replaced with an artificial joint also known as a prosthesis. The different surgical options available for hip replacement in India are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Traditional Hip Replacement: </strong></span>It is the most common hip replacement surgery performed in India where a surgeon makes an incision either on the side or back of the hip and then removes damaged bone and cartilage. The damaged femur is then replaced by a metal stem<strong>. </strong>A metal o<strong>r </strong>ceramic ball is attached that serves as a hip joint. The damaged socket is also replaced with a metal socket lined with plastic or ceramic.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partial Hip Replacement: </strong></span>This type of surgery is performed when only the femoral head is fractured but the socket around it is healthy. The femoral head is replaced with a metal prosthesis whereas the socket is left intact.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Hip Resurfacing: </span>I</strong>n this procedure, the femoral head is capped with a metal head instead of removing it completely. The damaged bone and cartilage in the socket are removed and replaced with a metal cup. This surgery is mainly considered for patients who are young and active and have good bone quality.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic Hip Replacement: </strong></span>It is a minimally invasive procedure where small incisions are placed using robotic instruments leading to less tissue disruption and also promises a faster recovery. The procedure is quite similar to conventional surgery except for the very small incisions<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precision and Innovation in hip Joint Surgery: When should you consider robotic hip replacement?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Robotic Hip replacement surgery in Apollo</strong> hospital can be considered under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complex anatomy</strong>:</span> Patients with complicated hip anatomy, like deformities or unusual bones, may benefit from robotics. Using the robotic system, doctors can do a more precise assessment and tailor their approach to the surgery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Problems with Traditional Techniques</strong>:</span> Patients with previous hip surgeries, joint deformities, or challenging anatomical variations might benefit from robotic assistance. Robotic systems can navigate and adapt to these complexities, so they can achieve optimal results.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Younger, more active patients</strong>:</span> <strong>Robotic hip replacement surgery in India</strong> may appeal to younger patients who live an active lifestyle and want to get back to their regular routines quicker. This group of patients might benefit from robotic assistance, like reduced tissue damage and better implant positioning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precision and Accuracy: The Revolutionary Impact of Robotic Hip Replacement ( Know the complete procedure)</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the surgery: </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several steps are taken initially to ensure that the surgical procedure guarantees the desired outcome. These steps include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The process begins with an initial consultation with the surgeon who is a specialist in robotic hip replacement. The entire medical history will be evaluated to make sure that you are the perfect candidate for the procedure. It includes X-rays and MRI scans to determine the extent of damage.</li>
<li>You may also be suggested to go through some preoperative tests like blood tests, ECG and other necessary evaluations performed to determine your overall health.</li>
<li>In <strong>robotic surgery,</strong> advanced imaging techniques are used to create a 3D model of the hip joint. Combined with X-ray reports and CT reports, the results of imaging help the surgeon to create a precise treatment option for you.</li>
<li>You will then be given detailed information about the procedure like risks, benefits and recovery time after the surgery. In this step, you will get an opportunity to clear all your doubts with your surgeon.</li>
<li>You’ll get specific instructions about preoperative prep for <strong>hip replacement surgery.</strong> It might include tips on fasting before surgery, stopping or continuing medication, and changing your lifestyle. Exercises or physical therapy might also be recommended to strengthen hip muscles and get fitter.</li>
<li>A consultation with an anesthesiologist can be conducted to evaluate your suitability for anaesthesia and discuss pain management options.</li>
<li>In case there are underlying medical conditions identified during the evaluation you may be referred to another specialist for further management and optimization of your health. Depending on the case, you might need to see a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or other specialist.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The surgical team will first prepare the surgical site by cleaning and sterilizing it.</li>
<li>The surgeon will then make a small incision near the hip joint. The location of the incision differs from case to case depending on the patient factors.</li>
<li>The surgeon then used specialized instruments to cut and remove damaged bone as well as cartilage, thus preparing the area for the placement of implants.</li>
<li>The robotic system is then calibrated. It involves attaching tracking devices to the legs of the patient and then connecting them to the robotic arm.</li>
<li>The robotic arm is then utilized to position the implants precisely to the desired area.</li>
<li>Artificial implants include a metal stem, ball and socket that are then inserted into the hip joint during <strong>hip replacement surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>The robotic system allows the surgeon to make changes to the plan for the best possible placement of implants.</li>
<li>Once the implants are inserted at the right place, the incisions are closed and sterile dressings are applied to the operated area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery after the surgery: The Immediate Postoperative Care You Need</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>You need immediate post-op care after <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery in Delhi.</strong>&nbsp;The type of anaesthesia the patient gets depends on their pre-anaesthesia checkup. Usually, it takes 1.5-2 hours to do the whole thing.</li>
<li>After that, the patient is shifted to the recovery room for monitoring. The recovery from robotic-assisted surgery usually takes 3-4 days since it’s minimally invasive and causes minimal muscle and ligament damage.</li>
<li>You’ll start walking with a walker the day after surgery. It takes 4-6 weeks for you to recover</li>
<li>Initially, you can’t sit on the floor and use a commode below 18 inches high.</li>
<li>In the two months following surgery, you’ll need a high-calcium diet and supplements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Safe Return to Daily Life: Precautions to follow</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Your surgeon will give you specific instructions about weight-bearing and activity restrictions. Initially, you’ll need to use crutches or a walker and avoid putting full weight on the leg. You’ll gradually be able to increase weight bearing and participate in specific exercises and activities as your surgeon directs.</li>
<li>To prevent infection and promote healing after <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>, take good care of your incision site. Keep your incision clean and dry by changing dressings and following your surgeon’s instructions. Tell your healthcare provider if you have redness, swelling, drainage, or fever.</li>
<li>Make sure you follow the recommended measures to prevent blood clots. You’ll need compression stockings, blood thinners, and leg exercises as directed by your healthcare team, as well as taking prescribed blood thinners.</li>
<li>Take all prescribed medications as directed, including pain meds, antibiotics, and other prescriptions for your specific needs. Take your medication as prescribed to manage pain, prevent infection, and support healing.</li>
<li>Regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon after<strong> hip replacement surgery</strong> are essential to tracking your progress, assessing healing, and making any necessary adjustments to your postoperative care plan. During your recovery, make sure you attend all your appointments and communicate any concerns or issues you might have.</li>
<li>Physical therapy is important for rehabilitation. Be sure to follow your physical therapist’s instructions and participate in your exercise program. It’ll help improve balance, strengthen muscles, and restore joint mobility</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic Hip Replacement : The Life Transforming Hip Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Creating a patient-specific 3D model of the hip joint:</span> </strong></span>The robotic surgery planning system makes a 3D model of the hip joint based on the patient’s anatomy. A surgeon can visualize the surgery and plan it based on the patient’s unique anatomy.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Better Control: </strong></span>The robotic arm adds accuracy and consistency to the surgeon’s hand. By doing this, the femur can be cut, the acetabulum can be reammed, and the implant components can be placed with more accuracy. As a result of robotics, inaccuracies can be reduced by up to 94%, reducing risks of leg length shortening, dislocations, and other complications.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Safe Zone: </strong></span>All surgical cutting and reaming tools remain within the safe zone thanks to the specifications of the 3D model of the hip. As a result, you can make sure the implant components are angled and positioned as planned.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Robotic Surgery: </strong></span>With its highly precise movements, the robotic arm can operate in tight spaces and through smaller incisions. As a result, surrounding tissues get minimal damage. <strong>Robotic hip replacement surgery in India</strong> is minimally invasive and doesn’t cut any muscles around the hip.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Enhanced Outcomes: </strong></span>A study published by the American Hip Institute followed 162 patients who underwent robot-assisted hip replacement surgery for 2 years. It’s true! These patients experienced it and confirmed it.</li>

</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cost of robotic hip replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In India, there are many factors which determine the<strong> cost of hip replacement surgery</strong> such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Technology Used</strong>: </span>Othopedicians in India are using three techniques to replace damaged or diseased hip joints. These techniques are open, minimal access and robotics. The latest and most accurate technique is robotic hence more expensive than conventional surgery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quality of implant</strong>:</span> There are two types of implants available in India, imported and local Indian implants are cheap but long-lasting. Imported implants such as Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Zimmer are the best in the industry hence expensive but long-lasting. These implants may last for 25 -30 years if replaced through robots due to better alignment and less trauma after surgery. Type of implant used determines <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>hip replacement surgery cost in India</strong>“</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other factors: </strong></span>The cost also depends on credentialing, privileges and experience of an orthopaedic surgeon. Hospital brand, type, size, its quality certificate whether it is following JCI protocols or NABH protocols plays a vital role in costing. Big brands such as Apollo, Max, Fortis and Medanta follow American clinical protocols, hence they are expensive. <strong>R</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>obotic hip replacement surgery cost in Delhi</strong> is high </span>since they follow good quality standards concerning second or third tier cities.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery- Transforming Knee Replacement&nbsp; </strong><strong>Surgery for Better Lives</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic knee replacement surgery</strong> </span>is often called Knee arthroplasty surgery. This can help reduce discomfort and restore function in severely damaged knee joints. This operation entails removing diseased bone and cartilage from the lower end of the thighbone, upper end of the shinbone, and kneecap and replacing it with an implant consisting of metal alloys, high-grade plastics, and polymers to make an artificial joint. This new joint is designed and aligned to mimic the function of normal human joints.</p>
<p>It becomes mandatory for patients who are in pain due to an injury in their knee joint and when no other therapy seems to be working. This may commonly be caused by age-related osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When Pain Rules: Understanding the Need for Knee Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;A knee replacement surgery</strong> is typically considered when all other treatment options fail to provide relief for chronic knee pain. Here are some common situations when a person has to go for knee replacement surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> </span>It is one of the most common reasons for knee replacement. If traditional treatment options like pain medications, and physical therapy fail to provide relief, then knee replacement is the ultimate option.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis: </strong></span>It is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation in knee joints. If the inflammation cannot be controlled via pain medications, then knee replacement is the last option considered by the doctors.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Knee Deformity:</strong> </span>Severe knee deformities like bowing in or out of the knee, can lead to uneven distribution of weight and excessive joint wear. In such cases, <strong>knee replacement surgery in India</strong> is suggested to restore normal knee function.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Failed surgeries:</strong></span> In some cases, previous knee surgeries like arthroscopy or partial knee replacement may not have provided complete relief. A total knee replacement is considered a salvage option.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other cases: </strong></span>Knee replacement is also recommended for patients suffering from avascular necrosis, knee tumors, and severe knee joint infections.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Exploring Different surgical options available for Knee Replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Total knee replacement (TKR): </strong></span>This involves replacing the whole knee joint with artificial implants. To recreate the joint, the damaged cartilage and bone are removed and replaced with metal and plastic implants. TKR relieves joint pain, improves function, and restores mobility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partial Knee Replacements (PKRs): </strong></span>Also known as unicompartmental <strong>knee replacement surgery in Apollo</strong> Hospital, India, PKRs are done when only one compartment of the knee joint is damaged. During this procedure, only the damaged section of the knee is replaced with a prosthesis, preserving the healthy parts<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bilateral knee replacement: </strong></span>This involves replacing both knees at the same time. The procedure is good for patients with severe arthritis or damage to both knees, so they can recover and rehabilitate simultaneously.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic-assisted knee replacement: </strong></span>A robotic arm system helps the surgeon with the knee replacement. It can increase precision, and accuracy, and allow a more customized implant fit, which can lead to better results.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Choosing the right knee replacement option for your needs: A detailed look at the different options available to you</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Robotic-assisted<strong> knee replacement surgery in Delhi</strong> involves the use of a robot to assist the surgeon during the knee replacement procedure. Different types of robotic knee surgeries performed in India are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fully Automatic Knee Replacement: </strong></span>In this procedure, the entire surgery is performed by the robot with minimal or no input from the surgeon. It uses preoperative imaging data and advanced algorithms to plan and execute surgeries. Robotic systems use sensors and artificial intelligence to make adjustments in real-time to align implants and ensure they’re positioned correctly. In most cases, surgeons oversee the process and can intervene, but it’s mostly autonomous.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partially Automatic Knee Replacement: </strong></span>In a partially <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in India</strong>, there is a collaboration between the robotic system and the surgeon. The system provides real-time feedback to the surgeon and also guides the surgeon during the procedure. The surgeon takes control of the surgery and makes important decisions while the robotic system helps to enhance accuracy and precision during the procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Mako Robotic Knee Replacement-Empowering Patients with Precision and Accuracy</strong></span></h2>
<p>Over the years, knee replacement techniques and instrumentation have gone through countless improvements. In this technique, surgery is performed by a surgeon using a <strong>Mako Robotic Arm</strong>. The Mako system pre-plan your surgery and then the surgeon guides the arm to remove diseased bone or cartilage from the knee. The surgeon will then insert the implant. <strong>Mako technology</strong> was developed to provide a personalized surgical experience to patients based on their specific diagnoses and anatomy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Mako Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery in India – Know the complete procedure</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You will be advised to go through a comprehensive preoperative evaluation with the orthopedic surgeon to determine if you are a good candidate. A physical exam and diagnostic are part of this evaluation.</li>
<li>The surgeon will then discuss the benefits, risks, and expected outcomes of robotic knee replacement surgery. You can also ask any questions you have. A detailed list of preoperative instructions will be given, including medication management, fasting guidelines, and medications to stop.</li>
<li>X-rays and CT scans are used to create a 3D model of the knee joint using advanced imaging techniques. Imaging data is used in conjunction with specialized software to develop a surgical plan. The surgeon can see how bad the joint is, plan the implant positioning and alignment, and determine which prosthetic pieces are the right size and fit.</li>
<li>You may be advised to undergo preoperative medical clearance in the days leading up to&nbsp; <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in Apollo Hospital,</strong> which might include blood tests, ECGs, and other exams.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery: </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The surgery begins with a CT scan of the knee joint that is used to generate a virtual 3D model. This model is then loaded into the Mako System software and is used to create a personalized treatment plan.</li>
<li>The robotic arm and the pre-operative plan are synced and the arthritic portions of the bone appear green on the 3D model.</li>
<li>The surgeon then guides the robotic arm to remove the damaged bone. With the use of Haptic technology, the surgeon only removed the damaged area eliminating the risk of damaging the healthy bone and ligaments.</li>
<li>The Mako robot provides the exact coordinates to the surgeon for the implants. It also confirms the gaps on the inside and outside of the knee remain the same throughout the arc of motion. This results in a knee that moves efficiently with a perfect balance.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery After the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Robotic knee replacements usually heal quicker than traditional knee replacements.</li>
<li>Most people return home the same day after surgery and can walk within a few hours</li>
<li>It takes about 3-6 weeks for you to fully recover from <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>.</li>
<li>There may be a need for physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the knee.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precautions to follow after the surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Strictly adhere to the post-operative instructions provided by the surgeon to ensure maximum recovery.</li>
<li>Take pain medications on time to avoid severe pain and discomfort.</li>
<li>Take complete rest and do gentle movements after the surgery. Avoid heavy exercises or any kind of movement that can strain the surgical area.</li>
<li>Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol because excessive drinking and smoking can interfere with the recovery process.</li>
<li>Make sure to attend all the follow-up appointments with your doctor to avoid any future complications.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Traditional vs. Robotic Surgery for Knee Replacement- Which is Better?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In the last few decades, knee replacement surgery has been the preferred treatment. This method relies heavily on X-rays for visual evaluation and manual direction.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional total knee replacement surgery</strong> involves an incision around 10 to 12 inches long. While this was the procedure used for a while and it helped patients. It’s invasive, painful, and takes a while to recover. Additionally, because conventional knee replacement surgery relies on vision and human judgment and the technique relies on bone section and soft tissue balance, it’s more likely to misalign.</p>
<p>In robotic TKA, dynamic referencing is used to assess knee stability, alignment, and range of motion while operating on the patient. This allows adjustments to be made to bone resection and prosthesis positioning during surgery. Due to the limited soft-tissue dissection and muscle injury, inflammation is reduced.</p>
<p>Compared to conventional knee replacement, <strong>robotic knee replacement</strong> has less pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and better flexion and straight leg tests after surgery on discharge.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The Profound Benefits of Robotic Knee Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Robotic Knee Replacement surgery has the following advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Enhanced Precision: </strong></span>Robotic Assisted Knee Replacement offers enhanced precision and accuracy. The computer system uses advanced algorithms to create a 3D model of the knee which helps the surgeon to perform the procedure with greater precision.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Personalized Treatment: </strong></span>The anatomy of every patient is unique and the robotic system helps to create a customized surgical plan for every individual. The pre-operative planning ensures a correct implant size and alignment. With such advantages, the outcomes are better.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Small Incisions: </strong></span>As compared to conventional knee replacement,<strong> robotic knee replacement surgery in India</strong>&nbsp;allows small incisions. It allows accurate bone preparation which helps to preserve healthy bone and soft tissue.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fewer Complications: </strong></span>Since robotic surgery is extremely precise, it has fewer complications. Accurate implant positioning and alignment decrease the chances of implant loosening leading to improved longevity and better outcomes.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fast Recovery: </strong></span>Studies have shown that patients who have robotic knee replacements feel better faster than those who have traditional knee replacements. Smaller incisions, less tissue damage, and better alignment can lead to a quicker return to normal activity and quicker rehab.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Improved patient satisfaction:</strong></span> Precision, personalized treatment, and faster recovery can lead to better patient satisfaction. In the long run, patients may be able to enjoy better knee function, less pain, and a quicker return to their favourite activity.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Factors that Affect Robotic Cataract Surgery in India</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cataract surgeries have become faster and hassle free with the new technology that uses laser system to operate on cataract patients. Also known as robotic cataract surgery, this technology uses femtosecond laser machine and the incision into cornea is made using a robot. The whole surgery gets completed in 30 seconds. Here are some factors that effet the robotioc cataract surgery in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Severe Eye Conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients having severe eye condition like glaucoma , advanced diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration may not be suitable for robotic cataract surgery due to the risks involved in the surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Previous Eye Surgery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patinets who have undergone multiple eye surgeries or have had complications from previous surgeries, may not be the suitable candidate for the cataract surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Abnormalities in Cornea: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who have corneal abnormalieties like :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irregular astigmatism</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corneal scarring&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thin corneas</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These people are not suitable candidate of the robotic cataract surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>General Health Conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients with significant health issues like&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncontrolled diabetes</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypertension</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto immune disorders</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are not the suitable candidates of the robotic cataract surgery as these conditions slow down the healing and increase risk of complications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Mature Cataract: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mature cataract is an advanced stage of cataract development where the lens of the ye becomes clouded and leads to vision impairment. Performing robotic cataract surgery becomes difficult in such situations due to hard nature of lens. It becomes difficult for robotic system to remove cataract material in such cases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Small Non Dilating Pupil: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is a condition when pupil size is insufficiently large or fails to dilate during the surgical procedure. A small pupil will limit the access to the lens and thus make it challenging for the robot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Cost Factors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robotic Cataract surgery is more costly than traditional cataract surgery. If you considering it, you should take your financial condition in account and also check insurance coverage before opting this procedure.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. It can develop anywhere in the brain, such as the protective lining, skull base, brainstem, nasal cavity, and more. There are estimated to be 120 different types of brain tumors. Throughout this article, we’ll explore brain tumor types, symptoms, causes, and <strong>brain tumor surgery in India</strong>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>A look at the different types of brain tumors</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>There are two types of brain tumors:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benign:</strong></span> These brain tumors don’t grow fast and have well-defined borders. There’s no invasion or spread to other body parts, as they are non-cancerous.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Malignant:</strong> </span>These brain tumors grow fast and are cancerous. Aside from invading nearby areas, they spread to different body parts. They’re the most aggressive form of brain tumor and can be deadly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Brain Tumor Surgery in Delhi: Understanding the Types&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Gliomas: </strong></span>This type of tumor starts in the nerve cells in the brain. Although the tumors can be benign, they’re primarily malignant. The most common malignant brain tumor is glioblastoma.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Choroid Plexus Tumors: </strong></span>These tumors start in the cells that make the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They can be benign or malignant, and most are in kids.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Embryonic Tumors: </strong></span>These start from cells in the brain after birth. They’re malignant brain tumors that primarily affect babies.</p>
<p>Germ cell tumors start from reproductive cells that become eggs and sperm. They are usually found in the ovaries and testes, but they can also be found in the brain. Children tend to get germ cell tumors more often, and they’re usually benign.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pineal Tumors: </strong></span>Pineal Tumors start around and inside the pineal gland. It’s common for children and adults to get these tumors, which can be benign or malignant.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Nerve tumors:</span></strong> Doctors doing <strong>brain tumor surgery in India</strong> say that these are tumors in or around nerves. This happens on the main nerve that connects the inner ear with the brain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pituitary Tumors: </strong></span>These start in or around the pituitary gland and are usually benign. In some cases, the tumor happens in the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Brain Tumor Surgery India: Silent Signals to Help Us Recognize Them</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;">Some common symptoms of brain tumors are:</span></h3>
<p>● A brain tumor is characterized by persistent headaches, especially in the morning, vomiting, and nausea.</p>
<p>● The most common symptom of brain tumors is seizures, especially in people without a history of seizures.</p>
<p>● People with <strong>brain tumors</strong> can suffer from memory problems and other mental problems like thinking, reasoning, and solving problems.</p>
<p>● A brain tumor near the optic nerve can seriously damage hearing and cause double vision or partial or complete blindness.</p>
<p>● A brain tumor can affect your balance and coordination because it affects your cerebellum.</p>
<p>● A <strong>brain tumor</strong> increases intracranial pressure, leading to nausea and vomiting, especially in the morning.</p>
<p>● The nervous system can be severely harmed by tumors, causing numbness and weakness in the legs and other parts.</p>
<p>● Brain tumors can also damage the parts of the brain that control speech and language. Hence, someone with a brain tumor might slur their speech, have trouble finding words, etc.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How is a brain tumor diagnosed?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Diagnosis of a brain tumor before <strong>minimal access brain tumor surgery in India</strong> begins with a detailed neurological exam. The physical tests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>C.T. Scan of Head</li>
<li>MRI Brain</li>
<li>Angiography of the brain arteries</li>
<li>Skull X-Ray</li>
<li>Biopsy of the brain tissue</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Brain Tumor Surgery India: Latest Treatment Options Available</strong></span></h2>
<p>Neurosurgery, Radiotherapy, or chemotherapy are the most widely used treatment modalities. However, with the advancement in medical technology, new treatments have been devised in India to cure people suffering from brain tumors. Some of these treatments are:</p>
<p><strong>Neuroendoscopy surgery</strong> is a <strong>minimally invasive brain tumor surgery</strong> used to treat brain tumors using an endoscope. It allows surgeons to visualize and perform the surgical area using small incisions through natural body openings like the nose and mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma Knife Surgery</strong>: <strong>Gamma knife surgery</strong> is also known as stereotactic surgery. It is a noninvasive surgical technique that uses a particular device known as a gamma knife. It is a helmet-like structure containing cobalt-60 radiation sources. The radiation damages the DNA of the targeted cells so that the tumor does not grow further.</p>
<p><strong>Cyberknife</strong>: It’s a noninvasive <strong>robotic radiosurgery </strong>system for treating brain tumors. It delivers high-dose radiation with real-time adjustments for patient movement. It’s painless, outpatient, and has minimal side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Proton Therapy</strong>: Proton therapy uses protons instead of X-rays to treat cancer. The radiation is highly targeted, so there’s less damage to healthy tissue around it. This treatment is perfect for treating tumors near critical structures and in kids since it’s more precise and has fewer side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted drug therap</strong>y-&nbsp; <strong>Targeted drug therapy</strong>, or precision medicine, uses drugs to target genetic mutations or molecules involved in the growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Craniotomy: </strong>It is a type of <strong>brain tumor surgery in Indi</strong>a that involves opening the skull to gain access to the brain tumor.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Craniotomy: A detailed look into the most popular brain tumor surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A craniotomy is a<strong> brain surgery</strong> where the neurosurgeon opens a piece of the skull to reach the brain. The same piece of skull is reapplied after the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Exploring Different Types of Craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are several types of craniotomy procedures. The type depends on where the surgeon accesses your skull. The significant types of craniotomy surgeries include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stereotactic craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>Stereotactic craniotomies use MRI or C.T. scans. During this procedure of your <strong>brain tumor surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital,</strong> your surgeon takes pictures of your brain in three dimensions. It helps them distinguish between healthy and abnormal tissue. In addition, stereotactic techniques help your surgeon find the best spot to cut your scalp. This makes it easier to make minor cuts and do minimally invasive surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Endoscopic craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>During an<strong> endoscopic brain tumor surgery in Delhi</strong>, your surgeon makes a tiny hole in your skull. Then, they insert an endoscope, a small camera with lights. It’s commonly used with keyhole craniotomies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Awake craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>The awake craniotomy is done while you’re awake. During surgery, your surgeon monitors your brain activity while asking you questions. They’ll tell you which parts of the brain control speech, movement, and vision as you respond. While performing the surgery, they’ll avoid these areas.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Keyhole craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>Keyhole craniotomies remove brain tumors. This is a <strong>minimally invasive brain tumor surgery</strong> with less scarring and a faster recovery. First, you’ll get a small cut behind your ear. Then, through this incision, the brain tumor is removed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Supra-orbital ‘eyebrow’ craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>To remove brain tumors from your forehead, you have a supra-orbital craniotomy. A small cut is made on your eyebrow. The procedure is minimally invasive and leaves minimal scars.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pteronial (frontotemporal) craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>The frontal, temporal, sphenoid, and parietal bones meet in a pterion. You’ll find it on the side of your skull near your temple. During a personal craniotomy, part of the pterion is removed. Next, your surgeon makes an incision behind your hairline so they can access multiple parts of your brain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Orbitozygomatic craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>Orbitozygomatic craniotomies are suitable for challenging tumors and aneurysms. First, there’s a small incision behind your hairline. In this procedure, your surgeon removes part of the bone that curves around your eye socket and cheek. It lets your surgeon reach deeper regions of your brain while reducing damage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Craniotomy of the posterior fossa</strong></span></p>
<p>The lower part of the skull is the posterior fossa. This part of the brain is near the brainstem and cerebellum, which controls balance and coordination. Tumors in the posterior fossa can put pressure on the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. A <strong>craniotomy</strong> in the posterior fossa can get rid of the tumor. This is done through an incision at the base of your skull.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Craniotomy Procedure: Understanding the complete procedure of brain tumor surgery in India step-by-step</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Various tests are performed before the<strong> brain tumor surgery</strong>, like a physical exam, blood tests, neurological exam, and a C.T. scan or an MRI.</li>
<li>Your surgeon will also determine the surgical site and the type of craniotomy he will perform on you. The surgeon will also discuss potential risks and a detailed treatment plan with expected outcomes.</li>
<li>Some pre-operative tests, such as ECG and pulmonary function tests, are performed before the surgery to determine the patient’s overall health.</li>
<li>You will also be instructed to fast a day before the surgery.</li>
<li>A consultation with an anesthesiologist will help to determine the most appropriate anesthesia technique required for <strong>brain tumor surgery in India</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery:</strong></span></h3>
<p>The following steps are performed to treat brain tumors:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Anesthesia:</span> </strong>The surgery starts with giving anesthesia to the patient to ensure they remain pain-free throughout the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Incision: </strong></span>Various types of incisions are made depending on the affected area of the brain. It can be made behind the hairline, in front of the ear, or anywhere else. If an endoscope is used, the incision made will be small. After the incision, a blonde flap is removed carefully.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery: </strong></span>After removing the flap, the surgeon will assess the brain. The surgeon will then remove the tumor using specialized instruments.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Intraoperative Monitoring and Navigation:</strong></span> The surgeon can use intraoperative monitoring techniques to check brain function and ensure critical parts are safe during the procedure. It can involve monitoring electrical activity, blood flow, or nerve activity. In some cases, image-guided navigation can help locate the surgical target precisely.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Closure and recovery</strong>:</span> After the <strong>endoscopic brain tumor surgery in India</strong>, the surgeon replaces the bone flap with plates, screws, or wires to hold it in place. Usually, sutures or staples are used to close the scalp incision. Following surgery, they will be transferred to the recovery room, where they will be closely monitored.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Immediately after the surgery, you will be taken to the recovery room and kept under observation.</li>
<li>The recovery period depends on the type of surgery done and the type of anesthesia given.</li>
<li>You may need oxygen for some amount of time after the surgery. However, it is discontinued when you will go home after the surgery.</li>
<li>You will also be taught specific deep breathing exercises to prevent pneumonia.</li>
<li>
<h3>Frequent neurological checks are done after the surgery to ensure the brain works correctly.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precautions after the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Following the instructions provided by your healthcare team after the surgery is essential.</li>
<li>Take proper care of the incision to prevent infection. Keep the incision clean to avoid infection and swelling.</li>
<li>Maintain an elevated head position to reduce swelling in the surgical area.</li>
<li>They have limited physical activities, as advised by the surgeon. Avoid heavy exercises to avoid any strain at the surgical site.</li>
<li>Take medicines at time to manage pain and infection. Do not stop or alter medications at your own will.</li>
<li>Take sufficient rest as it fastracks the recovery process. Listen to your body and avoid pushing it too hard.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Craniotomy: Enhancing Neurological Health and Well Being</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>A<strong> craniotomy surgery in India allows</strong>&nbsp;neurosurgeons to get directly to tumors and remove them. In this procedure, the tumor can be located precisely and resected maximally for improved outcomes.</li>
<li>Brain biopsies allow neurosurgeons to make accurate diagnoses. This allows for more targeted and personalized treatment choices.</li>
<li>Specialized monitoring techniques can assess brain function, such as electrical activity and blood flow, during a craniotomy. Real-time monitoring minimizes complications and ensures safety during surgery.</li>
<li>Advanced imaging techniques, such as MRIs and CT scans, can be integrated with surgical navigation. With this technology, surgeons can find their surgical targets accurately, enhance precision, and minimize damage to nearby healthy brain tissue.</li>
<li>Each craniotomy procedure is tailored to a patient’s specific condition. Surgeons can optimize patient outcomes based on the location, size, and nature of the pathology.</li>
<li><strong>Craniotomy surgery in Delhi</strong> continues to improve through advances in surgical techniques, imaging technologies, and intraoperative monitoring tools. With these advances, surgery is more precise, minimally invasive, and safe.</li>

<p>Pituitary Tumors develop in the pituitary gland, which is about the size of a pea and located at the base of the skull. They may produce too many hormones that control various body functions.</p>
<p>Most of these tumors are benign, which means they are noncancerous. They can be removed with <strong>pituitary tumor surgery in India</strong>, and their growth can be controlled via radiation and medications.</p>
<p><strong>Pituitary gland tumors</strong> can be treated in several ways. Here, we will focus on the most popular surgery: Endoscopic surgery. We will also discuss the types of pituitary tumors and their associated symptoms. Let us delve into the details one by one.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Pituitary Tumors</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>There are three kinds of pituitary tumors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pituitary benign adenomas:</strong></span> Those aren’t cancerous. A pituitary tumor grows slowly and doesn’t spread.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>‘Invasive pituitary adenomas:</strong></span> Benign tumors that can spread to the skull or sinus cavity.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pituitary carcinomas</strong>:</span> Cancerous tumors in the pituitary gland. They can spread to other parts of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or even outside of it. There are very few malignant pituitary tumors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Depending on the type and size of the tumor, the pituitary function may be impaired or normal</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A non-functioning pituitary tumor doesn’t make extra hormones.</li>
<li>A functioning pituitary tumor produces more than normal hormones. Pituitary tumors are usually functioning ones.</li>
<li>The extra hormones made by pituitary tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of the disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recognizing The Symptoms of Pituitary tumor</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Pituitary tumors</strong> can press on or damage parts of the pituitary gland; thus, producing one or more hormones stops. The too little hormone will affect the gland or organ it controls. You might get these signs and symptoms if you are suffering from a pituitary gland tumor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some loss of vision.</li>
<li>Loss of body hair.</li>
<li>Women have less frequent or no menstrual periods or milk from the breasts.</li>
<li>In men, facial hair loss, breast tissue growth, and impotence.</li>
<li>In women and men, lower sex drive.</li>
<li>In children, growth impairment and delayed sexual development.</li>
<li><strong>Too much prolactin causes</strong> infertility in women and impotence in men.</li>
<li><strong>Too much ACTH may cause</strong> weight gain. Thin skin may have purple or pink stretch marks on the chest or abdomen.</li>
<li><strong>Too much growth hormone may cause</strong> adults to have acromegaly (growth of the bones in the face, hands, and feet). In children, the whole body may grow much taller and more extensive than usual.</li>
<li><strong>Too much thyroid-stimulating hormone may cause </strong>Irregular heartbeat and weight loss.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other general signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors</strong>:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is a pituitary tumor diagnosed? </strong></p>
<p>Your healthcare provider may perform the following tests before<strong> pituitary tumor surgery in Delhi.</strong> These tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>MRI</li>
<li>Blood and Urine tests to see hormonal levels</li>
<li>Eye and Neurological examination</li>
<li>Biopsy</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;">Treatment options available for Pituitary Tumor in India</span></h3>
<p>The treatment option depends on the following factors when you decide to get your tumor removal in India:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type and size of the tumor</li>
<li>If the tumor is making hormones</li>
<li>If the tumor is causing problems with vision</li>
<li>If the tumor has spread into the brain</li>
<li>If the tumor has recurred or has just been diagnosed</li>
</ul>
<p>The various treatment options to treat pituitary tumors in India are:</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pituitary Tumor Surgery in India</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Transsphenoidal Surgery:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong> TNTS surgery in India </strong>is a type of surgery in which instruments are inserted into the brain via an incision made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose to reach the pituitary gland. An endoscope and a curette are inserted through the nose and sphenoid bone to remove the tumor from the pituitary gland.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery: </b><span style="color: black;"><strong>Endoscopic pituitary tumor surgery in Delh</strong>i is a type of surgery in which an endoscope is inserted through a cut made at the back of the nose and then through the sphenoid bone to reach the pituitary gland</span><b>.</b></span> An endoscope is a thin tube-like instrument with a light to remove the tumor inside.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Craniotomy: </strong></span>It is a surgical procedure that involves opening the skull to gain access to the brain tumor.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation therapy</strong></span></h2>
<p>R<strong>adiation therapy</strong> kills cancer cells or stops them from growing with high-energy X-rays. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation to the cancerous area. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiosurgery with stereotactic heads</strong>: A rigid frame holds the head still during treatment. Radiation is aimed directly at the tumor by a machine. The procedure doesn’t involve surgery. You can also call it stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, or radiation surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Treatment with drugs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Pituitary tumors</strong> can be stopped from producing too many hormones with drugs.</p>
<h3><strong>Treatment with chemotherapy</strong></h3>
<p>Cancer of the pituitary gland can be treated with <strong>chemotherapy</strong> to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Chemotherapy kills or prevents cancer cells from dividing by killing or stopping them. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, it enters the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Chemotherapy works differently depending on the type of cancer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Endoscopic Trans-Nasal Trans-Sphenoidal Approach for Pituitary Adenomas- The Most Popular Treatment Option in India</span></h2>
<p><strong>TNTS&nbsp; surgery in India</strong> is a surgical procedure used to treat pituitary adenoma. In this procedure, the pituitary gland is reached straight via the nasal path, taking less time. It is minimally invasive, and the recovery time is quicker. Let’s dig into how this procedure is performed. It is the most popular treatment option in Indian hospitals for <strong>Pituitary Tumo</strong>r patients.</p>
<h3><strong>Before the surgery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You will have a detailed consultation with your neurosurgeon specializing in pituitary disorders in the <strong>best hospitals for pituitary tumor surgery in India</strong>. They will order several tests to understand the size, location, and type of tumor.</li>
<li>You may also undergo additional testing to evaluate any impact on your vision.</li>
<li>If you are on any medication that affects your hormones, your healthcare provider will adjust the medications to prepare you for the surgery.</li>
<li>Since you will be placed under anesthesia during the surgery, you will have a detailed discussion with the anesthesiologist to discuss the entire plan.</li>
<li>If you have any doubts or concerns regarding the surgery, have a detailed conversation with your healthcare provider to understand<strong> transnasal&nbsp;transsphenoidal surgery in India</strong> and its implications.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Knowing the Procedure</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Anesthesia:</strong></span> You will be put under general anesthesia to ensure comfort.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Nasal Passage Access:</span> </strong>The surgeon inserts an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera) behind the nasal passages and advances it towards the sphenoid sinus. To open the front of the sinus wall, the doctor removes a small portion of the nasal septum.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Sphenoid Sinus Entry:</span></strong> Once the surgeon reaches the sphenoid sinus, they cut a small hole in the bone to access the pituitary gland. This is usually done with specialized tools like drills or microdebriders.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tumor removal: </strong></span>The surgeon uses an endoscope and other microsurgical tools like a curette to remove the pituitary adenoma. The endoscope gives the surgeon a clear view of the surgical field and allows him to navigate the delicate structures.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgical closure:</strong></span> Afterwards, the surgeon closes the nasal passage and sphenoid sinus incisions. The healing process might involve tissue grafts or synthetic materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>After the Surgery</strong></h3>
<p>After<strong> TNTS surgery,</strong> here is what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the<strong> pituitary tumor surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital,</strong> you will be shifted to the ICU, where healthcare professionals will monitor your vitals, pain levels, and overall condition.</li>
<li>It is normal to experience some pain and discomfort for a few days after the surgery. Communicate your pain level to your healthcare providers after the surgery.</li>
<li>Since the surgery involves accessing the pituitary gland through the nasal passage, you must care for your nose during recovery. Use saline nasal sprays and keep the nasal passage moist.</li>
<li>The <strong>pituitary tumor</strong> affects the hormone level, and the surgery aims to return the hormone levels to normal. After the surgery, your hormone levels will be monitored closely to ensure complete recovery.</li>
<li>Attend all the follow-up appointments with your doctor to assess your progress and monitor your recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Recovery After the Surgery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pituitary Tumor Surgery in India</strong> involves an almost negligible incision, so there is no defragmentation of the patient’s face. As a result, it offers faster recovery time. Generally, the patients leave the hospital within two days.</li>
<li>General precautions include avoiding straining, heavy lifting, and nose blowing for at least a week.</li>
<li>Aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines are prohibited up to two weeks after surgery.</li>
<li>If everything goes normal, it may take two weeks to return to a routine.</li>
</ul>

The major advantages of this procedure are&nbsp; less bleeding and faster recovery. To approach the hardest brain area, otherwise requiring an open surgery (Craniotomy).</p>
<p>With world-class facilities and ultra-modern equipment, India has some of the best hospitals, with the highest success rate of TNTS surgery at one-tenth the cost of its Western counterparts. Let us know more about<strong> TNTS surgery in India</strong> and it’s associated costs.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Know Your TNTS Procedure</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> TNTS surgery in Delhi</strong> is performed under general anesthesia.</li>
<li>Then, your surgeon prepares the nasal cavity, and with the help of the 3D image-guiding system, he inserts the endoscope.</li>
<li>A small portion of the nasal septum is removed by the doctor to widen the front of the sinus wall.</li>
<li>The surgeon may remove Sella’s tiny bone to increase the visibility further.</li>
<li>Then, with the help of the dura opening, the surgeon reaches the pituitary gland and tumor.</li>
<li>The tumor is then removed from the other nostril with the help of a special tool called a curette.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Endoscopic Transnasal Transsphenoidal Recovery: What is it like after the surgery?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>This procedure involves an almost negligible incision, so there is no defragmentation of the patient’s face. As a result, <strong>endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal s</strong>urgery offers faster recovery time. Generally, the patients leave the hospital within a day or two.</p>
<p>General precautions include avoiding straining, heavy lifting, and nose blowing for at least a week. You may also be deprived of using asteroids or nasal spray. Aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines are prohibited up to two weeks after surgery. It may take two weeks to return to a normal routine if everything goes normal.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human brain is a complex organ that controls our thoughts, movements, and emotions. However, there are specific neurological disorders that can impair the normal functioning of the brain, which in turn causes a significant impact on the quality of life of an individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in India</strong> is a revolutionary treatment option for patients dealing with neurological disorders. In this specific guide, we will delve into the complete procedure and advantages of DBS, the conditions treated by it, and the risks associated with the surgery. Continue reading to learn more about this revolutionary treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>What is Deep Brain Stimulation?&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in Delhi</strong>, electrodes are implanted within some regions of the brain. These electrodes produce electrical impulses that are used to treat abnormal impulses. In DBS, a pacemaker-like device controls how much stimulation is delivered to the brain, placed under the skin in the chest. DBS is used to treat people whose neurons are not working correctly. <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation</strong> makes these neurons active and thus helps to improve the symptoms of various brain conditions. The DBS System involves three main components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>An electrode, </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or lead, is a thin insulated wire implanted through an opening in the skull.</span></i></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>The extension wire</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed under the head, neck, and shoulder skin, connects the electrode to the internal pulse generator.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>The IPG ( Implantable Pulse Generator)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the third piece of the DBS system implanted under the upper chest’s skin.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Conditions Treated By Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in India</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Parkinson’s disease: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS eases tremors and improves motor function by modulating neural circuits that control movement.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Essential Tremors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: An Essential Tremor is an involuntary shaking of your hands, head, or voice caused by a neurological disorder. <strong>Deep brain stimulation</strong> can help patients with essential tremors.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Dystonia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It’s when your muscles contract involuntarily, causing you to twist or repeat motions.<strong> Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital&nbsp;</strong> relieves dystonia by normalizing muscle contractions and improving motor control.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>OCD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery can help treat severe and treatment-resistant OCD. Using DBS, you can improve overall function and quality of life by targeting specific brain circuits.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Epilepsy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation</strong> is being explored as a potential epilepsy treatment, especially for people who don’t respond to traditional treatments. It reduces the frequency and severity of seizures by modulating brain activity.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Symptoms of the diseases treated by Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients may experience a variety of symptoms. The most common ones are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dystonia – Involuntary Muscle Contractions</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epilepsy – Uncontrollable jerking movements of arms and legs</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential Tremor – Essential Tremor is an involuntary shaking of your hands, head</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obsessive-compulsive disorders&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parkinson’s</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Testing and Diagnosis Before the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients with <strong>Parkinson’s disease</strong> have to undergo testing of motor functions on and off to determine the severity of their disease. <strong>Epilepsy testing</strong> includes electroencephalography, whereas patients suffering from OCD have to undergo Yale-Brown Obsessive Scale Testing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Some other tests may include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood and Urine Tests</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRI and CT Scans of the brain&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Deep Brain Surgery In India for Treating Parkinson’s: Understanding Everything in Detail</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Before the Surgery</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the surgery, your neurosurgeon will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the DBS device that has to be implanted in the brain.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have to undergo a series of MRI and CT scans to determine the best location for placing wires for the device.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must stop taking medications before the surgery if you are on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or blood thinners.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your neurosurgeon will ask you to wash your skin and hair with Hibiclens to avoid any infection before the <strong>deep brain stimulation surgery in Delhi.</strong></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including your Parkinson’s medicine, no food or drink will be allowed after midnight.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you get plenty of sleep. DBS is a long procedure. Make sure to get enough rest for favourable outcomes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>During the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This procedure begins with attaching a frame to the head. The frame will be attached to your head with velcro straps. The four pin sites will be injected with local anesthesia to reduce discomfort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MRI or CT scan is performed in this step. A box-shaped device is placed on top of the frame. Markers in the box help pinpoint the exact three-dimensional coordinates of the target on the scan. The <strong>best doctors for DBS Surgery in India</strong> use MRI / CT scans and special computer software to plan the electrode trajectory.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will then be taken to the operating room. You will lie on the table with a stereotactic frame on the head. You will remain awake during the surgery with light sedation to help you feel comfortable. A skin incision will be made across your head to expose the skull. Two quarter-size burr holes will be made on the left and right sides of the skull using the drill, allowing electrodes to pass through the brain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrodes are inserted through a small hole into the brain. Based on the MRI and CT scan calculations, they are inserted into a precise location. The placement accuracy is based on the number of tests where you will be asked to lift your arms, and legs. An electrode records the brain’s activity and displays the waveforms on a computer. It’s the longest part of the process. It has to be repeated on both sides of the brain. The surgical team can do their job with your patience and cooperation.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the exact nerve cells are located, the surgeon will replace the electrode with a permanent DBS electrode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Step 6: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the surgical team is satisfied with the electrode placement, a plastic cap is placed over the burr hole to keep the lead in place. A coil wire is left under the scalp for the later procedure. The incision is then closed with sutures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>After The Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be kept overnight for observation and monitoring. Patients are usually discharged the next day.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After implanting the electrodes, you might feel better than usual. Brain swelling around the electrode tip can last several days to weeks.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about a week, you’ll have outpatient surgery to implant the stimulator in your chest/abdomen.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;You’ll be under anesthesia for about an hour during this surgery. You can go home the same day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 7: T</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">his step happens a week after the first&nbsp; <strong>DBS surgery in India</strong>. A small incision is made under the collarbone, and a neurotransmitter is planted under the skin. An extension wire connects the lead to the stimulator/battery in the chest or abdomen under the scalp. The device will appear as a small bulge under the skin, but it’s usually not visible under clothes. Incisions take 6-8 weeks to heal, so you can’t lift anything. Follow the discharge instructions and do the neck exercises. You can take medication to ease the pain of an incision.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 8: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be scheduled for an OPD visit 10 days after surgery. The simulator will be programmed, and your medication dose will be adjusted. You might have to stop taking your meds for 12 hours before programming. You’ll help determine the best program to control your symptoms during the appointment. Make sure you bring your remote and charger to every appointment. It usually takes 3 to 4 visits to tweak the program settings for the best results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals may sometimes experience a brief tingling sensation when the stimulator is turned on for the first time. It’s important to keep in mind that Parkinson’s is a progressive disease and that symptoms tend to worsen over time. You must visit the neurologist’s office regularly to adjust the stimulation settings.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Results of the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Parkinson’s, the success rate of<strong> Deep Brain Stimulation surgery in India</strong> is 70 %. It has improved many patients’ slowness, tremors, and rigidity symptoms. It has helped people to get off medicines and lessen their side effects.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS has reduced hand tremors in about 60 to 90 % of people for essential tremors.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people suffering from dystonia, DBS has proved to be the most effective treatment option.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many patients have reported improvement in the quality of their lives after DBS surgery.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>What is it like living with a Stimulator?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The handheld controller allows you to turn your stimulator on and off and adjust the strength of the stimulation. Most people keep their stimulators on the whole day. Some patients with essential tremors can use it during the day and turn it off at night. You can adjust the settings with the help of your doctor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need a charging unit if your DBS has a rechargeable battery. Charging takes about an hour to two hours a week on average. Other devices like cell phones, pagers, microwaves, security doors, or anti-theft sensors won’t affect your stimulator. Ensure you carry your Implanted Device Identification card when flying since airport security detects them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery lasts for 10 to 15 years. Once the battery wears out, it can be replaced with a new battery. The procedure is performed under anesthesia. The new battery is placed in the same location.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Advantages of the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">The advantages of <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation surgery in Delhi</strong> are as follows:&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS has proven to be a very effective treatment option for people with neurological conditions. The electrodes used in the surgery deliver electric signals to the targeted brain parts, thus reducing the symptoms.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deep Brain Stimulation</strong> is an effective option for treating diseases that cause tremors in the body.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most neurological conditions need to be managed via medicines. DBS can help people suffering from various neurological disorders reduce their medication dependence by alleviating their symptoms.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS is a highly customizable treatment option. The stimulation parameters, like the intensity and frequency of the current, can be customized according to the needs of an individ</span><b>ual.&nbsp;</b></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the benefits of <strong>DBS surgery in Delhi</strong> is that it’s reversible. Unlike other surgeries, electrodes can be adjusted, turned off, or removed entirely. Patients can modify or stop the treatment with this flexibility if their condition change</span><b>s.</b></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Burr hole surgery in India</strong> is a type of neurosurgery used to treat various disorders involving the brain, skull, and other structures. To reach the underlying tissues, relieve pressure, or remove aberrant growths, a tiny hole must be made in the skull, generally using a specialized drill called a burr.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our brain is protected by a layer of thin tissues known as meninges. These meninges have blood vessels to carry blood to and from the brain. The dura is the outermost covering of the brain. Any head injury can cause these blood vessels to tear and bleed. As a result, blood might start building up in the dura matter, leading to subdural hematoma.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This buildup is dangerous and can cause death. However, this condition can be easily treated using <strong>burr hole surgery in&nbsp; Delhi</strong>, India. In this blog, we will delve into how a Burr hole Surgery is performed and the benefits of getting it done from India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Burr Hole Surgery in India: When is it required?&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common reasons burr holes are needed is a subdural hematoma. Since the veins in the brain are fragile and easy to break, a hematoma can lead to symptoms like headaches, seizures, and one-sided muscle weakness.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Other reasons why you may need a burr hole surgery in India are:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic Subdural Hematoma</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epidural hematoma</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain cancer</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pus around meninges</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrocephalus</span></li>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain bleeds</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burr holes are the first step to bigger, more complicated brain surgeries. Surgery on the brain requires access to soft tissue underneath the skull. <strong>Burr hole surgery in Delhi</strong> allows surgeons to guide their instruments into your brain carefully. Burr holes can be made at different spots on your skull so surgeons can reach a wider brain area. While putting a burr hole in the skull is delicate, it’s relatively easy.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Burr Hole Surgery in India: Understanding its different types</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burr hole surgery includes several different methods that are used to treat a variety of neurological problems. Each kind of burr hole surgery necessitates meticulous preparation, imaging guidance, and expert surgical methods. Many factors, like conditions being treated, surgical objectives, patient conditions, etc., play an important role in determining the treatment to be used. Let’s get deeper into a few of the most common types of burr hole surgery:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Burr Hole Craniostomy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> During this procedure, one or more burr holes are made in the skull to reach the brain. It is frequently used to treat s<strong>ubdural hematoma</strong>, where blood builds between the dura and the brain’s protective covering. The surgeon can release pressure on the brain by draining the hematoma through the burr hole.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Stereotactic Burr Hole Biopsy: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <strong>burr hole surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital</strong> treats brain tumors. In this method, the placement of the burr hole is accurately guided by high-tech imaging techniques like computed tomography (C.T.) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A biopsy needle is injected into the brain through the burr hole to retrieve a tissue sample for pathological investigation, which helps diagnose and select the best treatment for <strong>brain tumors.</strong></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ventriculostomy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A drainage tube is inserted into the brain’s ventricular system during the burr hole procedure called <strong>ventriculostomy.</strong> This method is typically used to treat disorders like hydrocephalus, in which the ventricles of the brain experience an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The burr hole allows insertion of the drainage tube, which relieves pressure by allowing the extra CSF to be reabsorbed and rerouted.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: <strong>DBS</strong> is a neurosurgical technique that inserts electrodes deep inside particular brain parts via burr holes. DBS is used to treat neurological disorders like<strong> Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Burr Hole Surgery in India-Understanding the Complete Process</b></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Before the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your healthcare professional will perform a thorough medical evaluation before the surgery. Your medical history must be completely and accurately disclosed, including any pre-existing diseases, allergies, medications, and past procedures.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to disclose all your medications to your neurosurgeon before the <strong>burr hole surgery in Delhi</strong></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observe your surgeon’s pre-operative fasting recommendations. To reduce the danger of aspiration during anesthesia, you will typically be requested to refrain from eating or drinking for a specified amount of time before the procedure.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must undergo a series of tests to determine your blood clotting capacity, general health, and any underlying medical disorder.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is advised to cut back or stop smoking and drinking before surgery if you do either. Alcohol and smoking can affect the healing of your wounds and how well anesthesia and medications work.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your surgeon will review the procedure’s risks, advantages, and potential side effects with you before the operation. You must understand the potential risks that can occur during the procedure.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>During the Burr Hole Surgery in India</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>best doctors for Burr Hole Surgery in India</strong>, first of all, analyze where exactly burr holes need to go. For this, they use diagnostic image testing to determine the condition you are suffering from. Once the location of the Burr hole is decided, the procedure is performed as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be given anesthesia during the procedure to not to feel any pain.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area that needs a burr hole will then be shaved and disinfected. The hair will be removed to wipe the skin with the sterile solution to minimize the risk of infection.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will then insert additional anesthesia in the skull so you do not feel anything.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will then incision the scalp to expose the skull.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will insert the burr hole in the skin using a special drill. The hole may be used to drain the fluid that is causing pressure in the brain.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the<strong> burr hole surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital</strong> is complete, you will be shifted to the recovery room. The hospital stay can last a couple of days to ensure your vitals are okay.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>After the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to take good care of the surgical incision. Keep the incision site tidy and dry per your healthcare provider’s instructions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow your surgeon’s instructions when taking prescribed drugs. To treat discomfort following surgery, this may also include antibiotics to avoid infection. Follow the recommended dosage and schedule, and let your doctor know if you have any negative reactions.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rest is essential for a speedy recovery. Avoid demanding tasks, hard lifting, and high physical activity during the early healing time.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can lessen swelling and encourage drainage by keeping your head elevated, especially while you sleep. For the first several days following surgery, try to avoid lying flat by using pillows or a recliner to support yourself.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay close attention to any infections or problems, such as pain, edema, redness, discharge, or fever. Inform your healthcare provider right away of any worries.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attend every one of your surgeon’s scheduled follow-up appointments. These visits are essential for tracking your development, removing stitches or staples as necessary, and answering any queries or concerns you may have.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Learning the Benefits of Burr Hole Surgery&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Burr hole surgery in India</strong> is a valuable method in neurosurgery due to its numerous benefits. Let’s explore the benefits in greater detail:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Minimally Invasive:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Burr hole surgery in Delhi</strong> has several important benefits, one of which is that it is minimally invasive. Burr hole operations include making small incisions in the skull instead of conventional open cranial surgery, minimizing tissue stress, and lowering the possibility of complications. As a result, patients experience smaller incisions, less postoperative discomfort, less blood loss, and quicker healing time frames.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Versatility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A variety of neurological diseases can be treated with <strong>burr hole surgery</strong>.

<p>A ventriculoperitoneal shunt is a device used to relieve pressure on the brain caused by the accumulation of tube fluid. <strong>V.P. shunt surgery in India </strong>is primarily a procedure used to treat a condition called Hydrocephalus. This condition occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid gets collected in the brain ventricles. To treat this condition, a V.P. shunt is placed inside one of the ventricles to stop the fluid from accumulating.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is Hydrocephalus, and How is it Diagnosed?</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which excessive brain fluid accumulates within the brain’s ventricles. CSF is a fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain, providing cushioning and nourishment.</p>
<p>In a healthy human, CSF is produced in the brain’s ventricles and circulates through the ventricular system, flowing through blood and the spinal cord and then absorbed back into the blood. However, in people who suffer from Hydrocephalus, there is an imbalance between the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, thus leading to an increase in the size of the ventricles.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #0048ad;">Hydrocephalus is diagnosed through the following methods:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical examination and medical history</strong>: The doctor will ask about symptoms and any relevant medical history. Physical examinations include checking for abnormal eye movements, head circumference, and bulging fontanelles (in infants).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong>: Imaging tests are essential for evaluating hydrocephalus severity. Common imaging techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultrasound</li>
<li>C.T. scan of the brain</li>
<li>MRI of the brain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)</strong>: This procedure can measure the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid and determine its composition. The procedure involves collecting a sample of CSF from the lower back.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms of Hydrocephalus</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The common symptoms of <strong>Hydrocephalus</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger head size</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Excessive sleepiness</li>
<li>Poor appetite</li>
<li>Memory loss</li>
<li>Poor control and coordination</li>
<li>Impaired vision</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment Options to Treat Hydrocephalus</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are several treatment options available to treat Hydrocephalus. The common treatment options available in India are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Shunt Placement:</span> </strong></span>It is India’s most common <strong>treatment option for Hydrocephalus</strong>. A shunt is a thin tube placed inside the brain’s ventricles to drain excessive CSF and redirect it to another body part, typically the abdomen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>ETV: </strong></span>In cases where Hydrocephalus is caused by an obstruction in the brain’s ventricular system, ETV is performed. Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy creates a small hole in the brain’s third ventricle, allowing the CSF to flow without obstruction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Medications: </strong></span>In certain cases, medications can be prescribed to manage the symptoms of Hydrocephalus. In certain instances, the excess fluid can be controlled using antibiotics.</p>
<p>However, the most effective procedure for people dealing with Hydrocephalus is the<strong> V.P. shunt surgery in Delhi</strong>. It reduces complications and promises a healthy life to people with this critical condition.</p>

<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery: </strong></span></h3>
<p><strong><em>Several steps are taken before the surgery to achieve optimal results. These steps are:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical Evaluation: </strong>Your neurosurgeon will complete a physical evaluation to know your symptoms and medical history. This examination determines if you are a perfect candidate for the surgery<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Pre-operative assessment: </strong>Before <strong>VP Shunt Surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital,</strong> you will likely undergo a preoperative assessment to evaluate your overall health. This includes blood tests, ECG, and other medical tests based on your medical history.</li>
<li><strong>Risks and benefits: </strong>Before the surgery, a complete discussion will occur between you and your healthcare team regarding the risks and benefits associated with the surgery. Knowing the potential complications before the surgery is crucial to be ready for the</li>
<li><strong>Preparing for the surgery: </strong>You may be given specific instructions before the surgery, like quitting alcohol, smoking, and fasting. You will also be instructed to stop certain medications that can hinder the outcomes of the surgery.</li>
<li><strong>Anaesthesia Consultation: </strong>You will meet your anesthesia team before the <strong>VP Shunt Surgery in India</strong>. They will review your medical history to ensure you do not suffer any complications during the surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>V.P. Shunt Surgery India: Know How it is D</strong><b>one?</b></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The doctors place the V.P. shunt under general anesthesia. Usually, the entire procedure takes about 90 minutes. The whole procedure of placing the V.P. shunt is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surgery begins by making a tiny incision behind the ear. The surgeon also makes a small hole in the skull using a drill.</li>
<li>The <strong>best doctor for VP Shunt surgery in India</strong>&nbsp;will then insert a catheter into one of the brain’s ventricles, and the other catheter is passed down into the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li>A one-way valve is placed along the catheter under the skin. This valve helps regulate fluid flow from the brain to the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li>The two catheters are connected, and a small tunnel is created under the skin to allow the fluid to flow from the brain to the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li>The abdominal end of the catheter is placed within the peritoneal cavity, which is a space within the abdomen.</li>
<li>The incisions are then closed, and the entire area is bandaged.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Healing: The Road to Recovery</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You must know several things about the recovery process after <strong>ventriculoperitoneal (V.P.) shunt surgery in India</strong>. The recovery period looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay in the hospital: </strong>Patients stay there for a few days for close monitoring after surgery. During this time, the healthcare team will monitor the patient’s vital signs, how the shunt works, and manage pain.</li>
<li><strong>Incision Care: </strong>Ensuring the incision sites are clean is crucial to a quick recovery. After<strong> VP Shunt Surgery,</strong> patients are instructed to keep the incision clean and dry<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pain Management: </strong>Patients may experience discomfort or pain during surgery at incision sites. To manage the discomfort, pain medications will be prescribed. Be sure to take the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your pain worsens.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Activity and Restriction: </strong>Patients will get guidelines on physical activity and restrictions during recovery. Remember these instructions to prevent straining the surgical site and ensure it heals properly. Initially, the doctor may restrict activities, but patients can slowly resume normal activities.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and follow-up appointments: </strong>Patients are scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to check on the shunt and make any necessary adjustments. A CT scan or X-ray may evaluate a shunt’s positioning and effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precautions After the&nbsp; VP Shunt Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>It is crucial to take the following precautions after the surgery to ensure proper recovery and minimize the risk of complications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take proper care of the incision. Keep it clean and dry.</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous exercise as it can put a strain on the surgical site. Increase your activity levels gradually.</li>
<li>Monitor your shunt function regularly. Immediately report any abnormal symptoms like headaches, irritability, and vomiting to your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Take prescribed medicines on time to prevent any kind of infection and effective management of pain after <strong>VP Shunt surgery in Delhi.</strong></li>
<li>Practice good hygiene to avoid any infection at the surgical site.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of V.P. Shunt Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are several advantages of <strong>V.P. shunt surgery in India.</strong> These advantages include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treatment for Hydrocephalus:</strong> The <strong>V.P. shunt surgery</strong> is well-established and effective. The procedure allows excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be diverted from the brain’s ventricles and absorbed elsewhere, reducing hydrocephalus symptoms and relieving pressure on the brain.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces symptoms and improves the quality of life</strong>: <strong>V.P. shunt surgery</strong> reduces the pressure in the brain caused by the accumulation of CSF. As a result, the patient’s quality of life can be enhanced, and they’ll be able to function better daily.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term&nbsp;</strong><b>management</b>. Shunt surgery handles Hydrocephalus for a long time. The shunt system drains CSF and prevents fluid buildup, so there’s less risk of complications and repeat invasive procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Customized treatment</strong>: V.P. shunt surgeries can be tailored to patients’ needs. A shunt system can be adjusted or revised to manage patient condition changes over time and optimize CSF drainage. As a result, Hydrocephalus can be managed in a personalized, ongoing way.</li>
<li><strong>A minimally invasive surgery</strong>: <strong>V.P. shunt surgery</strong> is a surgery, but it’s generally considered a minimally invasive procedure compared to other neurosurgical procedures. In most cases, the procedure involves small incisions and endoscopic techniques. With minimally invasive procedures, tissues are less traumatized, hospital stays are shorter, and recovery is faster.</li>
<li><strong>Wide availability</strong>: <strong>V.P. shunt surgery in India</strong> is widely available in hospitals and medical centers. Neurosurgeons and healthcare teams perform these surgeries so patients get quality care and get the best results.</li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An arteriovenous malformation is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that connect arteries and veins in the brain. The arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain, whereas veins carry oxygen-depleted blood from the heart to the lungs. For people who suffer from AVM, this normal process is disrupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of AVM is still not clear. Many people have it from birth, while some develop it later in life. In this article, we will delve into the surgical options available for the <strong>treatment of AVM in India</strong> and we will also look into how you can access the best AVM surgery in India. Please continue reading to learn everything about AVM and its treatment in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Arteriovenous Malformation Surgery in Delhi: Lets know the symptoms&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signs and symptoms of AVM do not appear until it ruptures, resulting in brain hemorrhage. Some people may also experience other symptoms like:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seizures</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle weakness</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakness or paralysis</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision loss</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulty in speaking</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsteadiness</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Some important facts you should know about AVM</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, the symptoms of AVM start appearing between ages 10 to 40. AVM damages brain tissues slowly, and symptoms appear in early adulthood.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVMs become stable in middle age.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most severe AVM involves a vein of Galen. It causes major symptoms that appear after birth. The vessel causes an accumulation of fluid in the brain leading to swelling in the brain.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>AVM Surgery in India: Understanding the Causes</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVMs have an unknown cause. The majority of brain AVMs form during fetal development. However, they can also develop after birth. People with <strong>Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome</strong>, or <strong>hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</strong> (HHT), may develop brain AVMs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In arteries, blood flows through increasingly smaller vessels, ending in capillaries, which slow blood flow. Capillaries deliver oxygen to surrounding brain tissue through their thin, porous walls. The oxygen-depleted blood passes through small blood vessels and into larger veins to replenish oxygen. In an AVM, the arteries and veins lack this network of smaller blood vessels. As a result, blood bypasses surrounding tissues by flowing directly from arteries to veins. To correct this defect, you need <strong>arteriovenous malformation surgery</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Why is it necessary to treat the brain AVM?</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since AVMs put extreme pressure on the walls of the arteries and veins, there are chances of life-threatening bleeding. Hence it is essential to have<strong> arteriovenous malformation surgery in India,</strong> to treat the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blood does not flow through capillaries in people with brain AVM. Instead flows directly from arteries to veins. As a result, surrounding brain tissues cannot absorb oxygen due to the fast speed of the blood. Without sufficient oxygen, brain tissues die hence leading to a stroke.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some AVMs are big, and they compress certain portions of the brain. This can even lead to brain damage.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>How are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) diagnosed?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&nbsp;Best doctors for AVN surgery in India</strong>, will order some imaging tests to detect AVM. These tests include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRA ( Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography)</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA ( Computed tomography angiography )</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Treatment Options available in India to treat AVM</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment choice depends on the location, type, and size of AVM. Treating this condition as soon as possible is the best way to avoid serious complications. The various treatment options available are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="color: black;"><b>Surgery: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors make a small incision near the AVM, sealing the surrounding veins and arteries. This doesn’t let them bleed. Through <strong>AVM Surgery in India,</strong> the blood flow is directed to normal blood vessels.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Embolization: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this procedure, a catheter gets inserted into an artery in your groin and moves to the AVM location. After that, a glue-like substance, coils, or another substance is injected into the AVM to slow or stop blood flow. Usually, this approach is used when the AVMs are big and have a lot of blood flowing through them.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Gamma Knife Surgery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this method, highly focused radiation beams dissolve AVM and make it easier to remove via surgery.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Embolization Surgery in India: Understanding the most popular treatment option in detail</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization is a minimally invasive procedure to <strong>treat AVM in India</strong>. It blocks or reduces the blood flow to the abnormal blood vessels. Let us understand everything about it in detail.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Before the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be asked to undergo a series of medical exams like an MRI, CT scan, and angiogram. This helps to determine the size and location of AVM.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will meet with an interventional radiologist to discuss the embolization procedure’s risks and benefits.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must follow certain instructions before the surgery, like fasting before the procedure and avoiding smoking, alcohol, and blood thinning medications.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also undergo certain tests like kidney function, heart function, liver function, and blood clotting time to determine whether you are a suitable candidate for the <strong>embolization surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the procedure requires anesthesia, you will also have a detailed meeting with the anesthesiologist to determine anesthesia options.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>During the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Anesthesia: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>AVM Surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hopsital</strong> begins with giving a local anesthetic to the place where the catheter has to be inserted. In some cases, general anesthesia is given too.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Catheter Insertion: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will insert a small flexible catheter into a blood vessel in the groin area. This is done using real-time X-Ray guidance. The catheter is taken to the location of the abnormality.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Angiography: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the catheter is in the right place, a dye is inserted, and X-Ray images are taken to visualize the area of abnormality.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Embolization Material Delivery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the target area is identified, the embolic material is delivered through the catheter to block blood flow. The material can be tiny particles, glue-like substances, coils, or liquids. The choice depends on the area to be targeted.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Follow-Up Angiography: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the embolic material is in place, additional angiography is done to determine its effectiveness. It is done to ensure that AVM is shrinking.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>After the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your condition, you will be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU).</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A physician will closely monitor your vital signs to detect immediate complications or changes in your condition after <strong>&nbsp;arteriovenous malformation surgery in India</strong>.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain medications or other appropriate pain management techniques are prescribed during recovery to ensure your comfort.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be observed for complications, such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to medications.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery time depends on the specific condition treated and the patient’s individual response.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An angiography or CT scan may be performed to confirm that the embolization is effective and blood flow to the target area has reduced.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of the hospital stay depends on the procedure and your condition. Some people are discharged on the same day, while others need more recovery.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your caregivers will receive specific discharge instructions regarding wound care, medication management, physical activity limitations, and any required follow-up appointments. You must follow these instructions closely to promote healing.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Embolization</strong> is followed up by regular follow-up appointments to assess long-term effectiveness. Follow-up visits will depend on each case and how the healthcare team recommends t</span><b>hem.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Knowing More About Coil Used During the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bare platinum coils are made of biocompatible platinum alloy with no additional covering or coating. It is a non-reactive material that is well-suited for use in the human body. The coil’s size and shape primarily depend upon the location of the abnormality of the AVM. At the same time, its diameter ranges from 0.015 inches to 0.038 inches. These coils may last up to 20 years after the , <strong>arteriovenous malformation surgery in Delhi.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Advantages of Embolization</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Embolization</strong> has several advantages. Let’s look at them:</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a minimally invasive procedure requiring less extensive surgery than other surgical options. Hence it involves fewer scars and faster recovery time.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is used to treat AVM by targeting abnormal blood vessels. Hence the surrounding tissues are preserved.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization can reduce the blood flow to abnormal blood vessels. It prevents complications caused by AVM by introducing embolic materials to block the blood vessels.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization can be customized to meet individual needs. An interventional radiologist or surgeon can adjust the type and amount of embolic material used to target specific blood vessels.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization may be used in conjunction with other treatments. It can be performed before surgery to reduce tumor size or AVM, making surgery easier and safer.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Embolization surgery in India</strong> can often be performed as an outpatient procedure or with a short stay in the hospital. Patients can return to their normal activities faster, and healthcare costs are reduced.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of complications associated with embolization generally is lower than that of open surgery.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The embolization procedure can be repeated if necessary. When embolization does not completely resolve the condition in a single procedure, the procedure can be repeated to further control blood flow.</span></li>

<p>Brain aneurysm surgery is a complex procedure to treat a potentially life-threatening brain condition. An aneurysm is a bulge or balloon-like development that forms when a weak area in the wall of a blood artery in the brain grows.</p>
<p>Untreated aneurysms can potentially burst, resulting in brain hemorrhage, a stroke, or even death. To treat or stop an aneurysm from rupturing, surgery is frequently advised. During this treatment, trained neurosurgeons carefully maneuver the complex network of blood vessels in the brain to fix the aneurysm and restore normal blood flow.</p>
<p>The success rates of brain aneurysm surgeries have significantly increased thanks to developments in medical technology and surgical methods.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Brain Aneurysm</strong></span></h3>
<p>The various types of brain aneurysms are:<br />
● <strong>Saccular Aneurysm:</strong> This type of aneurysm is a round sac-like structure filled with blood from a main artery or one of its branches. It is the most common type of aneurysm.<br />
● <strong>Fusiform Aneurysm:</strong> This type causes bulging on all sides of the artery.<br />
● <strong>Mycotic Aneurysm:</strong> Mycotic aneurysm is caused by an infection that affects arteries in the brain. The infection weakens the wall of the arteries, which causes the aneurysm to form.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What happens if a brain aneurysm ruptures?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are lots of health problems that can happen if a brain aneurysm ruptures, like:<br />
● Bleeding in the thin tissues covering and protecting the brain (the arachnoid layer).<br />
● Hemorrhagic stroke</p>
<p><strong>It can result in permanent brain damage or other complications, like:</strong></p>
<p>● <strong>Vasospasm:</strong> When blood vessels narrow or shut down, less oxygen gets to the brain.<br />
● <strong>Hydrocephalus:</strong> In hydrocephalus, your brain is under a lot of pressure due to blood or cerebrospinal fluid buildup.<br />
● Convulsions<br />
● Coma<br />
● Death</p>

<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the causes of brain aneurysms?</strong></span></p>
<p>Aneurysms develop on the walls of an artery when the brain becomes weak or thin. Sometimes people are born with aneurysms due to a congenital disability. Several other factors that cause aneurysms are:<br />
● Marfan syndrome<br />
● Fibromuscular dysplasia<br />
● Arteriovenous malformation<br />
● Polycystic kidney disease</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis of Brain Aneurysm</strong></span><br />
● MRI &amp; CT Scan brain<br />
● Angiogram<br />
● Transcranial Doppler<br />
● Cerebral Angiography</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding Brain Aneurysm Surgery in Detail: The Endovascular Coiling Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>● A comprehensive assessment by a neurosurgeon is required to assess the overall health condition, the nature of the aneurysm, and any potential risks or complications associated with the surgery.<br />
● The medical team will examine your medical background, including any pre-existing diseases, allergies, or prior surgeries.<br />
● You may undergo preoperative blood tests to assess the blood count, clotting capacity, and general health.<br />
● Before surgery, it may be necessary to temporarily stop using or change the dosage of some medications, such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. This lowers the possibility of significant bleeding occurring during the surgery.<br />
● It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by the medical team regarding medication management.<br />
● Before surgery, you may be told to fast for a specific time. This will ensure that you remain empty stomach throughout the procedure, lowering the risk of aspiration and anesthesia-related problems.<br />
● It is advised for patients who smoke to give up smoking before surgery. Smoking can reduce blood flow and raise the possibility of problems.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>● This procedure is carried out in the DSA lab under local anesthesia. An expert interventional Radiologist is needed for the aneurysm coiling procedure.<br />
● You’ll be given a hospital gown and asked to remove any clothing, jewelry, or other items at the start of the treatment. Once done, the nurse will ask you to lie backward on the X-ray table.<br />
● Then the intravenous line (IV) tube will be placed inside a vein of your hand or arm. Afterward, an electrocardiogram will be connected to monitor the heart’s electrical activity.<br />
● After cleaning the injection site, mainly the groin, the nurse injects the local anesthesia.<br />
● Then the surgeon will make a small incision to insert a catheter into the artery through the blood vessel. This catheter is guided by fluoroscopy to reach the affected artery in the brain.<br />
● To measure the shape and size of the aneurysm, the surgeon will inject contrast dye in and around the surrounding blood vessels.<br />
● Next, the surgeon inserts a smaller catheter into the central catheter. Once this small catheter reaches the aneurysm, the surgeon inserts the coil until it completely seals off it.<br />
● To seal the aneurysm completely, the interventional Radiologist will insert as many coils as he needs. Within the aneurysm, the coils will form a mesh-like structure that will serve as a support.<br />
● In order to ensure that the aneurysm has been sealed off completely, additional X-ray images will need to be taken following the packing of the aneurysm with coils. As long as the coil remains in place, it will act as a permanent fix for the aneurysm.<br />
● Lastly, after stitching the incision, he will remove the catheter and apply the bandage at the operation site.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>It is crucial to follow specific postoperative guidelines to enhance healing, avoid problems, and assist in a quick recovery after brain aneurysm surgery. Here are some standard postoperative safety measures:<br />
● After surgery, you will be moved to the ICU for intensive observation of vital signs, neurological conditions, and any complications.<br />
● Following the surgery, you are advised to avoid physical work and refrain from intense exercise. This limitation reduces the chances of bleeding, prevents stress on the surgical site, and aids in the healing process.<br />
● After brain aneurysm surgery, some level of pain or discomfort is average. The medical staff will administer a proper pain management plan, including medicines or other methods to lessen pain.<br />
● Proper care is necessary for the incision site in the scalp. You must follow the surgeon’s wound care guidelines and keep the incision area clean and dry.<br />
● The medical staff will provide guidelines for postoperative medications, including painkillers, antibiotics, and any required blood pressure medications.<br />
● After brain aneurysm surgery, scheduling frequent follow-up meetings with the neurosurgeon is critical. During these visits, the medical staff will evaluate your neurological condition, track the healing process, and handle any issues that could come up.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits of Brain Aneurysm Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>For patients suffering from brain aneurysms, this surgery has several important advantages. These advantages consist of:</p>
<p>● Brain aneurysm surgery is primarily designed to prevent aneurysm rupture. Aneurysms can rupture, causing life-threatening diseases like stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>
<p>● An aneurysm can rupture again and bleed again, causing severe complications. A brain aneurysm surgery fixes the aneurysm and stops further blood flow.</p>
<p>● Headaches, vision problems, and neurological abnormalities can be signs of an unruptured brain aneurysm. The surgery can relieve these problems and enable patients to live a more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>● Improved surgical methods and technology have reduced the risk of problems associated with brain aneurysm surgery.</p>
<p>● Patients who have successfully undergone brain aneurysm surgery have long-term stability.</p>
<p>● A complete recovery is possible depending on the location and size of the aneurysm.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Brachial Plexus</strong></span> is the collection of the nerves in the arms, responsible for controlling the movement of the wrist, hands, shoulders, and elbow. In India, severe <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>brachial plexus injuries</strong></span> are treated by performing <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Brachial Plexus surgery</strong> </span>in top-notch neurosurgery hospitals. The stereotactic procedure uses a three-dimensional coordination system to locate the target area precisely.</p>
<p>Top neurosurgeons performing Stereotactic Procedures/<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Brachial Plexus Injuries in India</strong></span> are highly skilled and experienced in spinal surgery. India has many single-specialty spine hospitals offering affordable brachial plexus surgery compared to western hospitals.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Brachial Plexus Injury Surgery in India</span></h2>
<p>Some common types of<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> brachial plexus injury treatment</strong></span> available in Indian hospitals include:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Nerve grafting: </strong></span>In this process, the damaged part of the brachial plexus is replaced by sections of nerves from the other part of the body. That is why this procedure is known as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nerve grafting</strong></span>.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Nerve transfer:</strong></span> This procedure is adopted when a nerve from the spinal cord is ripped off. In this case, the surgeon replaces the ripped-off nerve with a less critical attached nerve, or in extreme cases, a combination of nerve grafting and nerve transfer is performed.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Muscle transfer: </strong></span>As the name suggests, under this procedure of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>brachial plexus injury surgery in Delhi,</strong></span> a surgeon replaces the defective muscle or ligament of your arm with a less critical muscle from other parts of the body. Once the transfer is successful, the surgeon restores the nerves and blood vessels supplied to that muscle.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Brachial Plexus Injuries: The Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>To diagnose the severity of the injury you may undergo one or more of the following tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>X-RAY</li>
<li>Nerve Conduction studies</li>
<li>MRI</li>
<li>Computerized Tomography</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Brachial Plexus Injury Surgery India: Understanding the Procedure</span></h2>
<p>Depending on your condition, your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>top doctor for brachial plexus surgery in India </strong></span>may select the best type of surgery. After that, you will be given general anesthesia. A team of anesthetists will continuously monitor your condition for the entire duration of operations.</p>
<p>In most procedures, an incision is made just above the collarbone. If the damage persists, the surgeon may perform the second operation by having an incision near the shoulder. The procedure is performed using high-powered microscopic equipment along with modern tiny tools.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery Time after Brachial Plexus Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<p>The recovery depends upon the type and severity of the injury.&nbsp; In most cases, it can take a patient a few years to recover fully from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>brachial plexus injury.</strong></span>&nbsp; This is due to the slow growth rate of the nerve tissue. &nbsp;For a speedy recovery and better joint flexibility, the patients are advised to follow an exercise schedule.</p>

<p>Spinal surgery was always complicated, with large incisions and more extended recovery periods. But thanks to advanced medical procedures like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Microdiscectomy</strong></span>, the patients get relief from unbearable pain and have better mobility. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Microdiscectomy surgery in India</strong></span>, popularly known as microdecompression, is a surgical procedure used to treat sciatica and lumbar herniated discs under high-end microscopes and robots.</p>
<p>The human spinal column consists of several bones stacked over one another and a fibrocartilage disc is placed between two bones. This disc acts as a shock absorber during any accident or injury, the disc gets displaced or slipped towards a spinal nerve resulting in its compression and unbearable pain.</p>
<p>With a low cost of treatment and zero waiting period for international patients, India has emerged as a hotspot of medical tourism.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Microdiscectomy Surgery Delhi: How is it performed?&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p>The surgery relieves the patient by removing the displaced disc from the body. Compared to the traditional methods, this surgery is performed with a minimal incision under a microscope. The patient is under the influence of general anesthesia and will be unconscious during the entire process as discussed below:</p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 1:</strong> </span>1 to 1.5 inches incision will be made above the affected disc.<br />
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 2:</strong></span> The top surgeon f<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>or microdiscectomy surgery in India </strong></span>may use a lighted microscope to examine the affected area.<br />
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 3:</strong> </span>With the help of scissors or other tools, the surgeon will gently remove the damaged herniated tissue. If required, he may also remove a small portion of the bone.<br />
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 4:</strong></span> The surgeon will close the incision with sutures.<br />
●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Step 5:</strong></span> Depending upon your condition, you may be discharged on the same day or the next morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Robotic spine surgery In India</strong></span> is one of the unique techniques introduced in India’s field of spine surgery. It increases the accuracy and thereby improves the success rate. In robotic surgery, the process is carried out through a small incision by a robotic hand, which makes even the complex procedure easy and more flexible.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Microdiscectomy Surgery Recovery Time</span></h2>
<p>Some advantages of minimally invasive spine surgery are quicker recovery, less hospital stay, and less muscle and soft tissue damage. Patients experience less pain after surgery and return to daily activity in a short period. It also involves fewer complications.</p>
<p>For better and faster <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>recovery after microdiscectomy surgery</strong></span> avoid sitting for a prolonged period, lifting heavy things, driving the vehicle, and immediately bending over after the surgery for 2-3 weeks. In normal conditions, a patient needs six weeks for full recovery.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Factors that Affect Microdiscectomy Surgery Cost in India</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Microdiscectomy is a specialized procedure that is used to alleviate pain and discomfort caused by herniated discs and the lumbar spine. It is a minimally invasive surgery that is quite popular because of its effectiveness and fast recovery time. Let us see what are the factors affecting <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of microdiscectomy surgery&nbsp; in India</strong></span>:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The type of hospital you choose for the surgery greatly affects the cost. If the hospital is JCI accredited, comes under a brand name and is a single specialty, then the cost of the surgery will be higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Location of the Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the hospital also affects the Price. If you get the surgery done in a bigger and more developed affluent city in India, the cost of the surgery will be higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Surgeon’s Fee: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon’s expertise, skill, and the number of successful surgeries performed also determine the total <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of Microdiscectomy surgery in Delhi.&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p><b>The extent of the disc damage: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost also depends on the complexity of the procedure. If the damage to the spine is greater, the minimally invasive microdiscectomy will be more expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Technology Used: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The type of technology used also determines <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>microdiscectomy surgery cost in India</strong></span>:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost of endoscopic spine surgery: 3500 USD&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cost of minimally invasive spine surgery: 4000 USD&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hospital Stay: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of the hospital stay influences the total cost of the surgery. If there are any complications in the procedure, you have to stay for a longer time in the hospital, and hence, the cost will increase. The total cost also depends on the type of room you choose to stay in.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Technically, Scoliosis is an abnormal lateral (side) curvature of the spine. This occurs more commonly in teenage females. However, it is difficult to notice this problem until one may have uneven shoulders or hips due to the spine’s curve. Sometimes, scoliosis can be due to birth deformity or neuromuscular disorders like cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>If you want successful <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Scoliosis surgery in India</strong></span> at a low cost, then there is no better alternative than New Delhi. Get treated by world-renowned scoliosis surgeons to prevent any future complications.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Scoliosis Surgery in Delhi: The Diagnosis</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Physical Examination</li>
<li>CT Scan</li>
<li>X-ray</li>
<li>MRI</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is the Right Time for Scoliosis Surgery in India?&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>Most cases of scoliosis are mild and do not require any treatment. However, depending on the patient’s physical condition, the doctor may recommend back bracing and physical therapy.</p>
<p>Surgery is also recommended for a patient if he/she has a curve greater than 45 to 50 degrees, as it may affect lung function. The best age group to perform <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Scoliosis surgery in India</strong></span> is between 3 and 10 years when the child is still in the growing phase, as the curve tends to increase during the growth period. Surgery can also be performed on adults suffering from severe pain.</p>
<p>Many world-class doctors carry out <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>spinal surgeries in Delhi.</strong></span> Today, with the help of the latest technological advancements, doctors can significantly improve the curve in these hospitals.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Common Types of Scoliosis Surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad; text-decoration: underline;">Posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF)&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spinal fusion</strong> </span>is a very popular and complex procedure performed by experienced surgeons to treat deformities of the spine. The spinal fusion permanently connects two or more vertebrae of the spine and improves stability.&nbsp; Posterior lumbar interbody fusion is a surgical procedure where two painful vertebrates are fused into a single solid bone. This approach requires a 4 to 6-inch incision in the centre of the back.&nbsp; During the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> PLIF surgery in Delhi,</strong></span> the doctor removes the disc between two vertebrae and inserts a bone or bone-like piece into the void space to provide stability. The benefit of this procedure is that it provides effective relief and requires minimal invasion.&nbsp; Consequently, the patient experiences less post-operative pain.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad; text-decoration: underline;">Anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF)&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>The only difference between PLIF and ALIf is that PLIF is performed from the back while the latter is performed from the front. A 3 to 5-inch vertical incision is made in the lower abdomen to reach the peritoneum. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best doctors performing scoliosis surgery in India</strong></span> say that this procedure benefits patients who previously had undergone spinal surgery.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad; text-decoration: underline;">Anterior/Posterior spinal fusion&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>This procedure is generally performed on patients with high spinal fractures. The procedure is done from both back and front, offering a large surface area for bone fusion.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad; text-decoration: underline;">Extreme Lateral Interbody Fusion (XLIF)</span></h3>
<p>This procedure uses minimum incision to fuse two spine levels together. It can be performed on a single level or multiple levels. The benefit of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>XLIF Surgery in India</strong></span> is that it requires a small duration of surgery with minimum incision and has a low risk of infection.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad; text-decoration: underline;">Osteotomy&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>If you have a rigid scoliotic curve, your doctor may use this procedure to treat the deformity of your spinal cord. This procedure will improve the patient’s overall appearance and help him stand erect without help.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Scoliosis Spine Surgery in India: Factors Affecting the Cost</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scoliosis is a medical condition in which the spine is curved and often looks deformed. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of scoliosis treatment in India</strong></span> may vary depending on several factors, such as the severity of the condition, the type of treatment required, geographical location, the healthcare system and your specific healthcare provider.&nbsp;Let us delve into the details of the factors affecting the cost of the treatment:&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Factors Affecting the Cost of Scoliosis Surgery in Delhi</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, the</span><b> severity of the condition</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plays a significant role in determining the cost. If the case is mild, then the treatment requires less invasive surgery, and on the other hand, if the case is severe, then more complex surgeries are needed, and hence the cost is high too.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>choice of surgery </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">also decides the cost. The estimate of the cost of various types of surgeries performed to treat scoliosis are:&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="2" style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Traditional spine fusion</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The average cost is </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">$8000 to $100,00, depending on the surgeon’s experience, hospital fees, and location.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="2"><b>Minimally Invasive Surgery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This advanced technique for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>scoliosis treatment in India&nbsp;</strong> </span>may have a higher initial cost, ranging from $9000 to $11000, but it can lead to less post-operative pain and a shorter hospital stay.</span></li>
<li aria-level="2"><b>Vertebral Body Tethering: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">VBT’s cost may range from $10000 to $12000, and it is often a lucrative option for its potential to preserve spinal flexibility.</span></li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>geographical location</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of the hospital also plays an essential role in deciding the overall c<strong>ost of the scoliosis surgery</strong>. Costs in top-tier cities of India are high.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>surgeon’s expertise a</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">lso plays a significant role in deciding the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of scoliosis surgery in Delhi</strong></span>. Highly experienced surgeons with high success rates and those who are board-certified tend to charge more.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>type of hospital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you choose also plays a significant role in deciding the overall cost. Superspeciality and single-speciality hospitals with high brand value, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Indian Spinal Injuries Centre, Indraprastha Apollo Hospital or Medanta the Medicity,</strong></span> are generally expensive.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Certification of the hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>JCI-certified hospitals</strong></span> are more expensive than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NABH-certified hospitals in India</strong></span> due to their robust clinical protocols and patient safety measures.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><b>cost of imported implants and prosthetic devices</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> like pedicle screws, rods, hooks, wires, and interbody fusion devices also play a significant role in deciding the overall cost of the surgery than Indian-made implants.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, p</span><b>re-surgical evaluations, post-operative care, and physical therapy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are essential aspects affecting the overall <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of scoliosis surgery in India</strong></span>.

Its treatment with the best Hospitals in India</span></h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kyphosis</strong></span> is a medical condition that causes forward bending in the patient’s spine, giving the person a stooped or rounded back. Reasons like developmental problems, degenerative diseases, fractures, tumours, or lousy posture may contribute to this condition.</p>
<p>This chronic condition is characterized by constant pain in the patient’s back, neck, and shoulders. It limits a person’s range of motion and restricts daily activities such as reaching overhead or twisting the back. In some instances, Kyphosis compresses the chest cavity, making breathing difficult and leading to shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Kyphosis, if noticeable, can also affect a person’s self-esteem and body image.</p>
<p>It is most commonly seen in women after menopause but can also affect men.</p>
<p>With minimum waiting time for surgery and state-of-the-art medical facilities, India has emerged as the perfect destination for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kyphoplasty surgery</strong></span>. It offers patients with world-class medical care with high success rates. <strong>Kyphoplasty surgery cost in India</strong> is also economical compared to that of European countries.</p>
<h2>Kyphoplasty Surgery in India: The Diagnosis</h2>

<li>X-rays</li>
<li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</li>
<li>Computed Tomography Scan</li>
<li>Bone Scintigraphy</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">&nbsp;Kyphoplasty Surgery In India: Understanding the Procedure</span></h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Kyphoplasty surgery</strong> </span>is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat vertebral compression fractures, often caused by Osteoporosis or Silent theft. This chronic condition is characterized by a loss of bone density and structural changes in bone tissues. Consequently, bones are fragile and prone to fractures, particularly in the spine, hip, and wrist areas. The condition can develop over many years without any noticeable symptoms.</p>
<p>The procedure is typically performed under local or general anaesthesia and takes around 60-90 minutes for one level. The surgeon will ask you to lie down on your stomach during the process. Once the patient is under anesthesia, the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">kyphoplasty surgeon in India</span></strong> makes a small incision at the place of the fracture in the back. Next, he inserts a hollow needle trocar into the vertebra.</p>
<p>The t<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>op doctors for Kyphoplasty surgery in India use</strong></span> Fluoroscopy as a guide to ensure that the needle is inserted at the right place. Once everything is intact, it’s time to insert a balloon-like device into the vertebra through the trocar. This balloon inflates once it reaches its position. It helps restore the height and shape of the vertebral body by opening the space between the bones. Next, cement-like material is injected into the vertebral body to stabilize and prevent further fractures. Afterwards, the surgeon closes the incision and applies a bandage to prevent infection.</p>

<p>Laminectomy is a surgical procedure used to treat patients suffering from spinal stenosis. A medical condition in which the space between the backbone becomes too small. This can happen due to bone spurs, which are frequent in a person suffering from arthritis. Bone spurs can be due to the person’s aging, or they can be inherited. Bony overgrowths exert pressure on the spinal cord and the nerves resulting in pain or muscle weakness.</p>
<p>The process is usually performed when there is no relief from traditional therapies like physical therapy, medication, or chiropractic care. The procedure aims to improve life quality by reducing pain and other symptoms. That helps patients to live more comfortable and productive life.</p>
<p><strong>Laminectomy surgery in India</strong> has a high success rate, and patients typically experience significant improvements in their symptoms. <strong>Laminectomy surgery in India</strong> <strong>is pocket-friendly</strong> compared to other developed countries. Also, India has a large pool of skilled and experienced surgeons specializing in laminectomy surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis of Spinal Stenosis</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Medical history and physical examination</li>
<li>MRI/ CT Scan</li>
<li>Nerve Conduction Studies</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Laminectomy Procedure </strong></span></h2>
<p>The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia by top spine surgeons at the leading <strong>Laminectomy Hospitals in India</strong>. It usually takes 1-2 hours for the procedure to get complete. But it can vary from case to case and person to person.</p>
<p>Firstly, the surgeon makes an incision either at the patient’s lower back or behind the neck. The objective is to make it as close as possible to the affected area. Next, he removes the lamina to create more space for the spinal cord and nerve roots. Once the bony roof of the vertebra is removed, the pressure exerted on the spinal cord and nerve roots gets released.</p>
<p>The surgeon will then close the incision with the help of sutures or surgical staples. He may also apply a bandage to cover the wounds even though the patient will be discharged on the same day. He has to rest for at least one week for the incision to heal properly.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) surgery i</strong></span>s a procedure used to treat patients suffering from spinal conditions like degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis. The process is usually performed on the spine’s lower region. It helps patients relieve pain, lower back pain, and leg aches.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TLIF Surgery in India</strong></span>&nbsp;offers several benefits, including improved stability and alignment of the spine, relief of chronic back pain, and preservation of motion in the lumbar region. Additionally, the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of TLIF in India</strong></span>&nbsp;is significantly lower compared to other countries, making it an affordable option for patients seeking quality and reliable treatment for their spine.</p>

<li>Physical Examination</li>
<li>X-rays</li>
<li>Computed Tomography Scan</li>
<li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimal Access TLIF Surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Minimal Access Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion (TLIF) surgery</strong></span> is a type of spinal surgery performed through a small incision. The surgeon uses specialized instruments like a microscope and endoscope during the process.</p>
<p>The surgery is typically performed under general anesthesia. First, the surgeon will make a small incision in the patient’s back. Then with the help of a tubular retractor, he will separate the muscles and other soft tissues. This provides better visibility and access to the affected vertebrate. Then the surgeon removes the damaged disc as it not only creates more space but also relieves any nerve compression that may be causing pain.</p>
<p>Afterward, the surgeon will place a spacer made of titanium or PEEK material between the affected vertebrae using special instruments like a cage or implant. The spacer is positioned so that it helps keep the affected vertebrae in proper alignment and promotes the fusion of the two vertebrae. The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>surgeon for TLIF surgery in India</strong> </span>will use small screws or other fixation devices to stabilize the area. This prevents any movement of the affected vertebrae. Finally, he will close the incision.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic TLIF Surgery in Delhi</strong></span></h2>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>robotic TLIF</strong> </span>procedure is more accurate and precise. It is performed by the surgeon using a robotic arm to remove the damaged disc. The robotic arms assist the surgeon in preparing the vertebrae for the bone graft and correctly placing the screws and rods. Afterward, the surgeon closes the incision and puts the patient in a brace. This immobilizes the spine and helps heal the bone graft. Robotic surgery causes less bleeding and infection post-operatively during surgery due to small incisions.</p>
<p>Although the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> robotic TLIF surgery in India</strong></span> offers faster recovery and better outcomes, the actual recovery depends upon the patient’s overall health and may vary from case to case.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Implant used in TLIF Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<h3><strong>Interbody cages</strong></h3>
<p>They are small, cylindrical-shaped devices that are inserted between the vertebrae. They are made of biocompatible materials like titanium.</p>
<h3><strong>PEEK cages</strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Polyetheretherketone cage</strong></span>s are just like traditional interbody cages. However, they are lightweight and made of synthetic material. They are resistant to wear and tear and are also radiolucent.</p>
<h3><strong>Stand-alone screws and rods</strong></h3>
<p>They are used to provide stability and support to the spine. And can be used with an interbody cage to give additional strength.</p>
<h3><strong>Hybrid constructs</strong></h3>
<p>Hybrid constructs combine different implants, like interbody cages and pedicle screws. It provides more stability and support to the spine.</p>
<h3><strong>3D printed implant</strong></h3>
<p>3D-printed implants are more tailored solutions as they are custom-manufactured for the patient. They are made from biocompatible materials like titanium but are expensive. Some best 3D implant manufacturers are <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Nexxt Spine, Medtronic, and Spine Vision.</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF surgery)</strong></span> is a surgical procedure performed to relieve symptoms caused by a herniated disc or spinal stenosis in the cervical (neck) region of the spine. When a person suffers from a herniated disc, then the gel-like center of a spinal disc bulges out from a tear in the disc’s outer ring.</p>
<p>On the other hand, spinal stenosis is a condition where the spinal canal narrows and starts exerting pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots. Both conditions can lead to neck pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arms and hands.</p>
<p>India offers the best choice for Anterior Cervical Discectomy &amp; Fusion procedures due to its highly skilled and experienced surgeons, advanced medical facilities, and affordable cost. The process is performed with precision and care, ensuring positive outcomes for patients who undergo<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> ACDF Surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimal Invasive Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) Surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>Unlike traditional ACDF surgery, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>minimal invasive ACDF surgery in India</strong></span> uses a small incision of no more than 1.5 inches near the front of the neck to access the spine. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia, with the patient positioned face-up on the operating table.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>top surgeon for ACDF surgery in India</strong></span> uses a tubular retractor to separate and hold the neck muscles and soft tissues apart during the procedure and may wear special magnifying eyeglasses or use a surgical microscope for a microscopic view of the surgical field. The damaged disc is removed, and a bone graft is placed between the vertebrae to promote fusion. A cervical plate or stand-alone implant may be used to provide additional stability. The procedure usually takes 30-45 minutes and is performed on an outpatient basis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic ACDF Surgery, the future of spine surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Robotic ACDF surgery in India</strong></span> is also a type of minimal incision surgery that offers more accuracy and precision. 3D high-definition robotic vision enables surgery to perform precise surgery, this helps in preventing injury to nerves and spinal cord during surgery. A robotic arm is used to assist the surgeon in placing a bone graft and screws to stabilize the spine.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Robotic ACDF surgery</strong> </span>is considered painless, infection and bloodless surgery and the recovery period is short.</p>

<p>PLIF surgery&nbsp; is a type of<strong>&nbsp;Spinal Fusion Surgery</strong>&nbsp;that is performed to treat a patient suffering from degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and spinal stenosis. This procedure removes the damaged disc between the two vertebrates and replaces it with a bone graft. This helps to alleviate pain, improve stability and alignment, and reduce nerve compression.</p>
<p><strong>PLIF surgery in India</strong>&nbsp;can cost up to 80% less than in other countries, which makes it an attractive option for many patients.</p>
<p>Additionally, Indian hospitals are known for their highly experienced surgeons and state-of-the-art medical facilities. They have high standards of patient care and excellent post-operative support.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis of Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion</strong></span></p>
<p>● Physical Examination</p>
<p>● X-rays</p>
<p>● MRI &amp; CT Scan</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Implant</strong></span></h2>
<h3>Interbody cages</h3>
<p>They are small, cylindrical-shaped devices that are inserted between the vertebrae. They are made of biocompatible materials like titanium.</p>
<h3>PEEK cages</h3>
<p>Polyetheretherketone cages are just like traditional interbody cages. However, they are lightweight and made of synthetic material. They are resistant to wear and tear and are also radiolucent.</p>
<h3>Stand-alone screws and rods</h3>
<p>They are used to provide stability and support to the spine. And can be used with an interbody cage to give additional strength.</p>
<h3>Hybrid constructs</h3>
<p>Hybrid constructs combine different implants, like interbody cages and pedicle screws. It provides more stability and support to the spine.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The procedure of Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion</strong></span></h2>
<p>Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion surgery can last anywhere from 2 to 3 hours. The surgery begins with a 1.5-inch to 2.5-inch incision in the midline of the back to access one or two levels of the spine. The muscles in the lower back are carefully dissected to reveal the lamina, spinous process, facet joints, and transverse process. The damaged disc is removed, and the space between the vertebrae is prepared for the bone graft. Special devices may hold the vertebrae in place while the bone graft fuses the two vertebrae.</p>
<p>After the bone graft is placed, the surgeon will use screws and rods to stabilize the spine, and then the muscles and skin are closed with sutures. Recovery time for this surgery can take several months, and physical therapy will be recommended to help patients regain strength and mobility.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion</span></h2>
<p><strong>Minimally invasive approach</strong></p>
<p>Minimally invasive spine surgery is an alternative to traditional surgery. During this procedure, the surgeon makes two smaller incisions on the back of the patient. This procedure reduces blood loss, and the patient experiences less pain than the traditional method.</p>
<p><strong>Robotics</strong></p>
<p>This procedure is more accurate and precise than any other procedure used for PLIF. It is done with the help of robotic arms with minimum incision. The process is usually performed on a patient who is experiencing anatomical challenges.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of PLIF Robotic Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>●&nbsp; </strong>Almost invisible surgical cut (~1-2 cm)</p>
<p>●&nbsp; It is a blood less and painless surgery</p>
<p>●&nbsp; 2 days stay in hospital ,faster recovery and rehabilitation period due to minimal invasive</p>
<p>●&nbsp; Robotic Surgery is safer, accurate and more precise</p>
<p>●&nbsp; Cosmetically compliant with almost no visible scars</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Approximate Cost of PLIF Surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>The cost of&nbsp; robotic PLIF surgery is less in India as compared to western countries and depends on the following factors:</p>
<p><strong>Hospital and Location</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hospital Reputation</strong>: There are other factors such as the popularity&nbsp; of the hospital or the level of development of the robotic surgery equipment which makes it expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Location</strong>: It has been noted that for hospitals situated in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore for instance relative to other cities, their costs of offering health services are normally higher.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic Technolog</strong>y</p>
<p>The type or the level of sophistication of the robotic system like the da Vinci Surgical System can go a long way in dramatically affecting the costs.</p>
<p><strong>Surgeon’s Expertise</strong></p>
<p>●&nbsp; A surgeon with many years of experience, and has a good reputation is likely to charge more.</p>
<p>●&nbsp; The cost entails the fees of the whole surgical team, anesthetists and specialists in robotic surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Operative and Post-Operative Care</strong></p>
<p>●&nbsp; Several expenses such as MRI, CT scans before surgery, and blood tests and other general tests before surgery also are other expenses.</p>
<p>●&nbsp; Bed days in the ICU, a follow-up visit, and rehabilitation services contribute to the expenses.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Stay</strong></p>
<p><strong>Duration</strong>: The cost of Robotic PLIF surgery in India will increase with the number of days you spend in the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Room Type:</strong> Coming to the second question, the nature of cost is affected differently by the decision to admit a patient in a private room as compared to a general ward.</p>
<h3><strong>Surgical Complexity</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Patient’s Condition</strong>: It is clear from the above breakdown that you are charged more for complicated cases that take time to operate, need more equipment, among other factors.</p>
<p><strong>Coexisting Conditions</strong>: The care that a patient with other illnesses such as diabetes or hypertension may require increases the cost of PLIF surgery in Delhi.</p>
<h3><strong>Medical Consumables</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Implants and Hardware</strong>: The type and quality of the spinal implants as well as other consumables used during the surgery do affect the cost.</p>
<h3><strong>Medications</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Pre and Post-Operative Medications</strong>: Money spent on medications that may have been prescribed before the operation and others that may be prescribed after the operation also play a role in boosting the cost of robotic PLIF surgery in India.</p>
<h3><strong>Insurance Coverage</strong></h3>
<p>Insurance Plans: The level of health insurance and choice of an individual to the network hospitals also affects the cost.</p>
<p>Thus, the cost incurred for the robotic PLIF surgery in India depends on half of the factors such as the reputation of the hospital, geographical location, cost of the robotic, technology level of the surgeon, pre and post-surgery care, days of hospitalization, level and extent of the surgery, cost of medical consumables, fee for the medications, and fee for insurance. It ranges from $4,000 to $9,000 USD or more in India.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic PLIF Surgery will cost you an additional 1000$.</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to note that this cost is an approximation, and the actual price may vary depending on the specific case and the treatment plan.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Spinal decompression surgery in India</strong></span> is a surgical treatment that is used to alleviate pain and discomfort caused by conditions such as herniated or bulging discs, sciatica, and degenerative disc disease. These conditions can cause severe discomfort and pain in the back and legs, making it difficult to move around and perform simple tasks.</p>
<p>Today India has emerged as the top destination for spinal decompression due to its highly skilled and experienced surgeons, state-of-the-art facilities, and affordable cost. The country also offers a variety of options for post-surgery rehabilitation and recovery.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Spinal Decompression Surgery India: The Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>● X- Rays</p>
<p>● Magnetic Resonance Imaging</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Surgical Decompression Surgery Delhi: Understanding the Procedure</span></h2>
<p>The procedure begins with the patient being placed under general anesthesia. Next, the surgeon incurs the patient’s back, usually in the lumbar (lower) region. The surgeon then carefully removes any damaged or herniated disc material that is pressing on the spinal cord or nerve roots.</p>
<p>After removing the disc material, the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>surgeon for spinal decompression surgery in India</strong> </span>may use a spinal decompression table device to stretch the spine gently. This helps to create more space between the vertebrae and relieve pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots.</p>
<p>In some cases, the surgeon may also perform a spinal fusion, which involves fusing two or more vertebrae to provide additional stability to the spine.</p>
<p>In certain cases, the spine needs fixation with screws and plates, generally, we use American-made impact however cost-effective Indian implants are also available.</p>
<p>The <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>spinal decompression surgery</strong></span> typically takes 1.5 hours to complete and patients are typically kept in the hospital for two days to recover.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Cost of Spinal Decompression Surgery in India</span></h2>
<p>Pain in the spine can be relieved in two ways, either by stabilizing the structure of the spine or by releasing the pressure on the nerves. Spine decompression surgery is a therapy that relieves the pressure on the neural components of your spine, thus providing you relief from back pain.</p>
<h3><strong>Here we will discuss the factors affecting the cost of spinal decompression in India:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>● The cost of surgery will depend on the type of surgery performed for example laminectomy, discectomy or microdiscectomy.</p>
<p>● The cost of the spinal decompression surgery in Delhi also depends on the techniques used to perform the surgery, minimally invasive or traditional approach.</p>
<p>● The cost also depends on the severity of the condition like the complexity of the lumbar spine problem.</p>
<p>● The cost will also be influenced by the choice of the hospital, reputation, location and the infrastructure of the hospital.</p>
<p>● The price also depends on the expertise of the surgeon performing spinal decompression surgery.</p>
<h3><strong>The total cost of spinal decompression surgery in India is also affected by the following things:&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>● Diagnostic tests before surgery</p>
<p>● Post operative care</p>
<p>● Age of patient</p>
<p>● Overall health of patient</p>
<p>● Post surgery rehabilitation</p>

This type of tumor affects vertebrae in the spine and is hence also known as a vertebral tumor. Due to unnoticeable symptoms, this tumor is often diagnosed late.</p>
<p>Malignant or benign spinal tumors are also possible. Your spinal cord tissues may get harmed if the tumor spreads further. Primary spinal tumors first appear in your spine or spinal cord. Metastatic or secondary tumors are the result of cancer migrating from your spine to another part of your body.</p>
<p>If you are diagnosed with this type of cancer, you will have to have <strong><u>spinal tumor surgery in India.</u></strong>&nbsp;The cost of surgery in India is reasonable compared to other countries. Our country is known for providing cutting-edge treatments and reasonable prices. Here at Medihelp Global , the best <strong><u>medical consultants in India</u></strong>, let us see how you can get spinal tumor treatment in India.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Understanding Spinal Tumor</span></strong></h2>
<p>A spinal tumor is an abnormal mass of cell growth that develops inside or outside the spinal cord. A spinal cord can develop in:</p>
<p>● Bones that form the spine</p>
<p>● The cartilage that protects the joints in the vertebrae</p>
<p>● Spinal discs that cushion the space between the vertebrae</p>
<p>● Blood vessels that supply nutrients to the spine</p>
<p>● Peripheral nerves that exit the vertebrae</p>
<p>● Dura mater, pia mater, and arachnoid mater, the three membrane layers</p>
<p>● Spinal cord</p>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Types of Spinal Tumors</span></strong></h3>
<p>Any tumor growth, whether cancerous or not, can press the nerves and cause pain and other neurological defects. Loss of sensation or muscle weakness, especially in the legs, difficulty in walking are some of the significant symptoms of a spinal tumor. There are different types of spinal tumors:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Type</b></td>
<td><strong>Explanation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extradural</td>
<td>Found outside the dura matter lining, and the most common type</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intradural</td>
<td>Part of the dura matter lining</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Intramedullary</td>
<td>Inside spinal cord</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Extramedullary</td>
<td>Inside the dura but outside the spinal cord</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong><u>Surgeons at Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals, New Delhi</u></strong>, treat spinal tumors even in the most inaccessible areas. High-powered microscopes used in surgery help remove even delicately placed intradural tumors. Total Spondylectomy—removal of the entire vertebra as a definitive cure—is also performed for some spinal tumors.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">What are the signs and symptoms of spine cancer? </span></strong></p>
<p>Some <strong><u>symptoms of spine cancer</u></strong>&nbsp;develop gradually, while others appear out of nowhere and start advancing. The primary symptoms include:</p>
<p>● Back and neck pain</p>
<p>● Leg or arm pain</p>
<p>● Fatigue paralysis</p>
<p>● Spinal deformities</p>
<p>● Loss of bowel function</p>
<p>● Difficulty in standing</p>
<p>● Numbness in extremities</p>
<p><strong>Who is at risk? </strong></p>
<p>● Men are at higher risk of developing spinal cord tumors than women</p>
<p>● Middle-aged older adults are also prone to spinal cord tumor</p>
<p>● Children below 9 years of age</p>
<p>● People with having family history of cancer</p>
<p>● People who are exposed to hazardous radiation.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis of Spinal Tumor in India</strong></p>
<p>Here are some lists of tests that are performed before <strong><u>spinal tumor treatment in India:</u></strong></p>
<p>● CT scan</p>
<p>● MRI scan</p>
<p>● Bone scan</p>
<p>● Biopsy</p>
<p>● PET CT scan</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Grades of Spinal Tumor</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Grade 1: </strong></p>
<p>● Benign or non-cancerous</p>
<p>● The tumor slowly grows in this stage</p>
<p>● No change in the structure if cell</p>
<p>● Have good prognosis</p>
<p><strong>Grade 2: </strong></p>
<p>● During this stage spinal cord tumor will grow at a slow stage</p>
<p>● The structure of tumor cells will begin to change</p>
<p>● Cancer begins to spread</p>
<p><strong>Grade 3:</strong></p>
<p>● The structure of cells becomes abnormal.</p>
<p>● The cancer cell begins dividing at a very fast rate</p>
<p>● Cancer begins to spread to the neighbouring structures</p>
<p><strong>Grade 4:</strong></p>
<p>● Cancerous</p>
<p>● Very aggressive</p>
<p>● The cancer cells multiply very fast</p>
<p>● The cell loses its structure</p>
<p><strong>What is spinal cord tumor staging?</strong></p>
<p>Staging helps to determine how much the cancer has spread. If the spinal cord tumor is secondary, staging is required. It is not needed when the tumor is primary because primary tumors will not spread beyond the nervous system.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Treatment of Spinal Tumor in India</span></strong></h2>
<p>The <strong><u>treatment of a spinal cord tumor in India</u></strong> depends on some factors, such as the patient’s age, general health, and the size and type of tumor. The results of the above tests will help you decide what is the best course of action before your spinal cord tumor treatment in India.</p>
<p>Treatment can be given for different reasons, and the potential benefits will vary for each person. If you’ve been offered treatment that aims to cure your cancer, deciding whether to have the treatment may not be difficult. However, if a cure is not possible and the treatment is to control the cancer for some time.</p>
<h3><strong>Non-Surgical Treatment Options for Spinal Tumor in India</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Radiotherapy: </strong>Radiotherapy is often used to treat malignant tumors that cannot be reached via surgery. It can also be used after the surgery to remove the tumor cells that could not be removed. <strong><u>Radiotherapy for spinal tumors</u></strong> uses X-rays and gamma rays to destroy the spine tumor. The treatment can both slow down the tumor growth and even eliminate it.</p>
<p><strong>Radio Surgery</strong>: Radiosurgery for spine tumor also uses radiotherapy and can be used as a treatment option when surgery is not possible due to the small size of tumors. Despite the name, it is a non-surgical treatment option and does not involve any incisions or cuts. It works by targeting high doses of radiation at the spine tumor to damage it. The treatment is given by a machine known as <strong><u>LINAC OR LINEAR ACCELERATOR or GAMMA KNIFE/Zap-X</u></strong>. Unlike radiotherapy, it requires several sessions over weeks and months and does not require an overnight stay in the hospital. You can return to your work the same day without any potential side effects of surgery or radiotherapy.</p>
<p><strong>Chemotherapy: <u>Chemotherapy for spinal tumor</u></strong>&nbsp;uses drugs to destroy tumor cells. Some chemotherapy drugs are taken by mouth, and some are given via drip into a vein. It is mostly given to people with metastatic spinal tumors. The complete course of chemo involves several cycles. The number of cycles is decided by the type of spine tumor you have.</p>
<h3><strong>Corticosteroids</strong></h3>
<p>Surgery and Radiation sometimes cause inflammation inside the spinal cord. To treat this, doctors also prescribe corticosteroids, but they should be used only for a short time; otherwise, they can cause many side effects.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Minimally Invasive Spinal Tumor Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● The surgery is performed under general anesthesia</p>
<p>● It can be performed as an open procedure or minimally invasive technique.</p>
<p>● An incision is made in the skin, and tissues are gently moved aside to create a path to the spine.</p>
<p>● <strong><u>Minimally invasive spinal tumor surgery in India</u></strong>&nbsp;minimizes the damage to the surrounding tissue to aid the faster recovery.</p>
<p>● Insertion of a catheter to the site of the tumor to deliver an embolic agent blocking the vessels supplying the tumor, thus controlling bleeding.</p>
<p>● The posterior approach allows the identification of the dura and exposure of the nerve roots. The anterior approach is performed for tumors in the front of the spine.</p>
<p>● After the Spine Tumor Surgery, the incisions are sewn together with sutures or staples to be removed 10-14 days after the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Hi-Tech Assisted Spinal Tumor Surgery – Neuronavigation Surgery </strong></p>
<p>While surgery is the first option to treat benign and malignant tumors, most modern surgical tools use Brain Suit Intra Operative MRI-guided robotic and laser surgery to improve the outcomes.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0b5394;">Spinal Decompression</span></strong></h2>
<p>The surgery removes the entire tumor or part of it. In this surgery, the spinal tumor can be debunked, completely removed, or partially removed. This type of surgery can decompress or relieve the pressure on the spinal cord and nerve roots, thus helping to reduce pain and symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Vertebroplasty:</strong> A minimally invasive procedure where bone cement is injected into fractured vertebrae to stabilize and reduce pain caused by spinal fractures.</p>
<p><strong>ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion): </strong>A surgery that removes a damaged disc in the neck, relieving pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, and fusing the vertebrae for stability.</p>
<p><strong>Laminectomy: </strong>A decompression surgery that removes part of the vertebra (lamina) to relieve pressure on the spinal cord or nerves, often due to spinal stenosis.</p>
<p><strong>PLIF (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion):</strong> A spinal fusion surgery where the damaged disc is removed from the back (posterior) and replaced with a bone graft to fuse the vertebrae.</p>
<p><strong>TLIF (Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion):</strong> A type of lumbar fusion surgery that accesses the spine through the side of the vertebrae, allowing removal of a disc and placement of bone graft for fusion.</p>
<p><strong>What can you expect after spinal tumor surgery in India? </strong></p>
<p>Your typical hospital stay will range from 5 to 10 days. A period of physical rehabilitation is also needed after the removal of the spinal tumor. This will require you to be in touch with physical therapists and doctors who specialize in physical recovery after major operations.</p>
<p><strong>Recovery after Spinal tumor surgery</strong></p>
<p>The <strong><u>total recovery time after the spinal surgery</u></strong> often depends on the complexity of the surgery. The healing process will continue several months after the surgery and may last for a year or more.</p>

<p>Electrophysiology studies and radiofrequency ablation are widely used procedures for treating palpitations. A condition where one can experience his heartbeat resulting in uncomfortable or unusual heart rate and rhythm. This is because the electrical conduction system takes different pathways.</p>
<p><span>Several world-class and affordable <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EPS and RFA treatments are</strong></span> <strong>available in India f</strong></span>or treating Palpitations. The hospitals are equipped with the latest equipment for accurately diagnosing the symptoms.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is an Electrophysiology Study?</strong></span></h2>
<p>An electrophysiology study determines the heart’s electrical activity. It helps the doctor to diagnose fast and abnormal heart rhythms.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is Radiofrequency Ablation?&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>It is a treatment for correcting abnormal heart rhythms by destroying affected heart tissues in a regulated or controlled environment. It is performed by inserting catheters into the heart through veins or arteries. There are two types of ablation:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> Catheter ablation and Cyro ablation</strong></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Catheter ablation</strong> uses radiofrequency energy to destroy tissue responsible for irregular heartbeats. Once this damaged tissue is destroyed, the heartbeat is restored to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Cryoablation</strong> uses an extremely cold liquid or a special instrument called cryoprobe to destroy the tissues that cause arrhythmia.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">EPS and RFA treatment Delhi: Understanding the Diagnosis</span></h2>
<p>Patients may undergo the following tests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrocardiogram</li>
<li>Holter Monitoring</li>
<li>Echocardiogram</li>
<li>Event Recording</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">3D Mapping</span>&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>3D mapping is usually performed to diagnose the source of the arrhythmia. It creates a multi-dimensional image of the heart that helps the doctor easily identify the abnormalities.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The procedure for EPS &amp; RFA Treatment in India</strong></span></h2>
<h3><strong>Electrophysiology Study</strong></h3>
<p>This is performed in a special lab called the catheterization lab. Then, a nurse will put an intravenous line in your arm. Depending upon the severity, the interventional cardiologist will perform general anesthesia. Before the procedure, you must shave your groin, neck, or arm area. After that, a small straw-sized tube is inserted into your artery.</p>
<p>With the help of specialized EP, catheters will be inserted into your vessel and heart. A video screen will guide the doctor through the entire process. Then, small electric pulses will be sent to register your heart’s response, known as cardiac mapping.</p>
<p>Once inside your heart, the electrode measures the electric signal, and in case of any abnormality, the same electrode sends electrical signals to stimulate the heart tissues.&nbsp; Electrophysiology is performed to identify the source of the abnormal heartbeat.</p>
<h3><strong>Radiofrequency Ablation&nbsp;</strong></h3>
<p>After cleaning the groin, the best doctor for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EPS and RFA treatment in India</strong> </span>will insert a tube into the vein or arteries of the groin with the help of a needle. You may feel dizzy for some time while under local anesthesia. Then, with the help of this tube, one or more catheters will be inserted until it reaches your heart.</p>
<p>Once it is in position, the doctor sends an electric signal through this wire. This helps the doctor identify the tissues which are causing an arrhythmia. Once the problematic tissue is identified, the catheter is placed next to it. A radiofrequency signal is then sent to destroy the damaged cell without causing any problems to the patient.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Approximate Cost for EPS &amp; RFA Treatment in India</span></strong></h2>
<p>On average, a 2<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>D Electrophysiology Study &amp; Radio Frequency Ablation Cost in India</strong> </span>is around $2500, whereas a 3D Electrophysiology Study &amp; Radio Frequency Ablation Cost in India is around $ 4000.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>EPS AND RFA Treatment in India: Factors Affecting the Cost</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrophysiology, or EPS, involves evaluating the heart’s electrical system to identify abnormal rhythms.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Determining the factors affecting the cost</b></h3>
<p><b>Type of Hospital You Choose: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The type of hospital you choose for your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>EPS and RFA treatment in India</strong></span> will significantly determine the overall cost of the surgery. The cost will be higher if the hospital is JCI accredited, a super-specialty hospital, or a single super-specialty hospital. The price can also be high if the hospital has a single dedicated cardiology unit. Above all, the hospital’s brand and reputation also decide the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Surgeon’s Credentials &amp; Fees: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A substantial expense with your EPS AND&nbsp; RFA Treatment will be your interventional cardiologist fee. We recommend getting the procedure done by only experienced, skilled, board-certified surgeons capable of delivering successful FR ablation procedures. Charges may vary from surgeon to surgeon, but the cost will always be higher if you get the procedure done by a skilled doctor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Type of Surgical Approach</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With improvement in patient care, new techniques and technologies are used in the treatment. The costs increase when the latest technology is used, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>3D mapping technology, cryoablation, and robotic assistance.</strong></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Location of the Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the hospital plays a major role in deciding the total <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>cost of EPS and RFA treatment in India.</strong></span>&nbsp; If the hospital is located in the top-tier cities of India, then the treatment cost will be higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Other factors determining the cost of EPS and RFA treatment in Delhi</b></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Heart arrhythmia treatment in India</strong>: <strong>Bringing Your Heart Back in Rhythm</strong></span></p>
<p>Arrhythmia is a heart disorder when the heart starts beating either too fast or too slow, causing an irregular rhythm.&nbsp; An <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>automatic Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator&nbsp; (</strong></span>AICD) is a small device implanted into a patient’s chest who is suffering from Arrhythmia. This device consists of a pulse generator that generates and sends electrical impulses or shocks to the heart during life-threatening situations. The electrodes present in the device help the generator by regularly monitoring the heart rhythm.</p>
<p>There are various options available for <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>heart arrhythmia treatment in India.</strong></span> With advanced medical technology, the best surgeons, and world-class infrastructures, heart surgeries in India have excellent outcomes.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Heart arrhythmia treatment in India: How is the </strong>Diagnosis done?</span></h2>
<p>The patient must undergo a series of investigations to diagnose irregular heartbeat. Your surgeon may also ask you for a thyroid test to know better about your condition. Some common heart monitoring tests under which a patient may be subjected include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holter monitor</li>
<li>Stress test</li>
<li>Event Recorder</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram</li>
<li>Electrophysiological testing and Mapping</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Best AICD companies</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Medtronic</li>
<li>Boston Scientific</li>
<li>Biotronic</li>
<li>Livanova</li>
<li>Abbott</li>
<li>Medico</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Arrhythmia treatment surgery: Types of AICD Implantation&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>There are two types of AICD</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional AICD –</strong> This is implanted in the chest with wires attached to the heart. This procedure requires massive surgery.</li>
<li><strong>A subcutaneous ICD –</strong> This is implanted under the person’s armpit. Under this, the device is not in direct contact with the heart but connected through electrodes. This is further subdivided into</li>
<li><strong>Single Chamber:</strong> The lead is attached to the heart’s right ventricle to restore the heart rhythm.</li>
<li><strong>Dual Chamber: </strong>Under this procedure, the leads are attached to the right ventricle and right atrium.</li>
<li><strong>Biventricular ICD: </strong>This provides a more efficient way to regulate the heartbeats by connecting the leads to the right atrium, right ventricle, and coronary sinus.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Best ICD Treatment in India: The Procedure of AICD Implantation&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>The entire procedure will take not more than an hour. The best<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> ICD doctor in India</strong> </span>will use light sedation to make you feel comfortable and relaxed throughout the process. Local anesthesia will be applied to the bone collar. After this, the cardiologist will make a 5-8 cm long cut to place the device. The electrodes which help in monitoring the rhythm of the heartbeat are connected to the heart with the help of a vein.</p>
<p>After this process, a small dressing is applied to the incision, depending on your condition. The doctor may ask you to have bed rest for one to four hours.</p>
<p>Pacemakers are generally classified based on the number of heart chambers that the device stimulates. A single-chamber Pacemaker typically targets the right RTM or the right ventricle. In contrast, a dual chamber targets both the right RTM and the right ventricle.</p>
<p><strong>Which AICD is the Best?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>For <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>arrhythmia treatment in India</strong></span>, a dual-chamber ICD is always better than a single-chamber because it has two leads, one in the upper chamber and the other in the heart’s lower chamber. As a result, it provides better and more natural functioning of the heart.</p>
<p><strong>The battery life of a dual-chamber AICD may vary from 5-15 years, whereas a single-chamber pacemaker can last for 7 years.</strong></p>
<p>The procedure to change the battery of the pacemaker is quicker and requires less recovery time when compared to its implantation.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cost of AICD Implantation</strong></span></h2>
<p>The c<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>ost of dual chamber AICD implantation in India</strong></span> is around 12,000 USD. And may vary depending on the severity of the problem and the choice of the hospital. In contrast, a single-chamber ICD device costs around USD 9000 in a top hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital stay for AICD surgery</strong> – 2 days</p>
<p><strong>Indian stay for whole procedure</strong> 10 days</p>
<p><strong>The success rate of the surgery</strong> – 99%</p>

<p>An Angioplasty is a minimal surgical procedure used to widen the obstructed arteries or veins of the heart. The procedure is performed on patients who have suffered a heart attack.&nbsp; When a person suffers from atherosclerosis, fatty plaque builds up inside the heart’s arteries. Consequently, blocked and clogged arteries cause severe chest pain and shortness of breath.</p>
<p>Heart surgeries often involve higher risks and complications. Therefore, it must be carried out by professionals who are knowledgeable and experienced. India has some of the best hospitals worldwide for <span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>percutaneous transluminal angioplasty</strong> </span>or PTCA.&nbsp;</span> These hospitals have more than 98 percent success rates and have world-class infrastructure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>PTCA Surgery Delhi: Understanding the Types</b></span></p>
<p><strong>Angioplasty Ballon Procedure in India</strong></p>
<p>Under this process, a small catheter with a deflated balloon is inserted into the arteries. Once the catheter is closed to the plaque, the balloon is inflated. As a result, the blockage is removed, boosting the blood flow into the heart.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stent Placement in the Heart</strong></span></h2>
<p>During the<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> stent replacement surgery in India,</strong></span> the blockage is removed with the help of a stent. The stent is warped around the balloon and placed at the tip of the catheter. Once it reaches the blockage, the balloon is inflated, which expands the stent and locks it inside the artery.&nbsp; After this, the balloon is deflated and removed along with the catheter.</p>
<h3><strong>Atherectomy</strong></h3>
<p>This is a minimally invasive procedure and a type of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>PTCA surgery in India</strong></span> that removes plaque with the help of a tiny blade or laser. Under this process, the plague is shaved off or vaporized with a laser tied to the end of the catheter. The process is done on patients who have already undergone angioplasty but still have plaque blocking blood flow.</p>
<h3>Cutting Balloon&nbsp;Angioplasty</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, this type of <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>percutaneous transluminal angioplasty in India</strong></span> uses a unique angioplasty device. The process helps in reducing vessel stretch and injury. During this process, a special balloon catheter and small blades are used. Once it reaches the plague, the balloon is inflated, activating the blade and destroying it.</p>
<h3><strong>Robotic Angioplasty</strong></h3>
<p>One of the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>best PTCA surgeries in India</strong></span>, this procedure requires minimum invasion and offers greater accuracy. During the robotic procedure, the cardiologist uses live X-rays to track the position of the guide wires. The robotic arms provide the precise placement of the stent, which is not possible manually during complex cases.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;">PTCA Surgery India: The Diagnosis</span></h3>
<p>Besides the regular medical history checkup, doctors perform a series of tests to prepare for the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>angioplasty</strong></span>. These tests include:</p>
<p>● Chest X-Ray</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Electrocardiogram</p>
<p>● Blood tests</p>
<p>● Coronary Angiogram</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Procedure for PTCA surgery?</span></h2>
<p>The<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> PTCA surgery in Delhi</strong> </span>begins with the doctor providing local anesthesia into the groin area. Afterward, a guided wire with the introducer is placed inside the femoral artery. Next, the diagnostic catheter is advanced into the blood vessel with the help of an introducer. Once the catheter reaches the aorta, the guided wire is removed, and then the doctor injects dye and takes an X-ray.&nbsp; Depending upon the severity of the blockage, the doctor may use the balloon or stent placement procedure to widen the passage for blood flow. Before removing the catheter, the doctor may take the final x-ray to check for changes in the arteries.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>TAVI </strong></span>is the medical abbreviation of transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedure. The TAVI/TAVR surgery is performed to improve the blood flow in the heart by replacing the aortic valve, which does not open properly.</p>
<p>The aortic valve is situated between the left ventricle and the main artery of the body, known as the aorta. If the valve does not open properly, then the blood flow to the heart gets reduced. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0048ad; text-decoration: underline;">TAVI/TAVR surgery in India</span></span></strong>&nbsp;differs from other valve replacement procedures because it is minimally invasive.</p>
<p>Continue reading to know more about the procedure and see why India is the best country to get this procedure done.</p>
<h3><strong>TAVI/TAVR Surgery India: When is it done? </strong></h3>
<p>TAVI/TAVR is primarily done to treat aortic stenosis. It is a condition where the aortic valve becomes too narrow to allow the blood to flow from your heart to the rest of the body. You may also need the procedure if you experience the following symptoms:</p>
<p>● Fatigue<br />
● Light Headaches<br />
● Chest pain<br />
● Shortness of breath</p>
<p>According to the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>American Heart Association</strong></span>, aortic stenosis affects more than 20% of older Americans. It’s more common in people over 65 years of age.<br />
Depending on your age and health condition, you might not be eligible for open heart valve surgery. The TAVI/<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>TAVR surgery</strong></span></span>&nbsp;might be a good option in these situations.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who should not have TAVI?</strong></span></h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TAVI surgery in India</strong> </span>is a revolutionary procedure for heart valve replacement. However, this procedure is only recommended for selected patients. You cannot have TAVI if:<br />
● You have a congenital heart valve defect<br />
● The heart valve has an infection<br />
● A life expectancy of less than 1 year<br />
● Limited site for vascular access</p>
<h5><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></span></h5>
<p>To decide if <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TAVI/TAVR surgery in Delh</strong></span>i is the correct procedure for you, you will need to get the following tests done:</p>
<p>● Blood tests<br />
● ECG<br />
● CT Scans<br />
● Coronary angiogram<br />
● TEE<br />
● Chest X-Ray<br />
● Breathing Tests</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Best TAVI/ TAVR surgery in India</strong>: </span>Understanding TAVI in Detail</strong></span></h2>
<p>TAVI was initially used to replace aortic valves for people who couldn’t have open heart surgery. Researchers have shown that TAVI is just as effective as <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>heart valve surgery</strong></span> after one year for people at lower risk of complications. TAVI also works well over time in patients with severe aortic stenosis. Here is everything you need to know about the surgery</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p><em><span style="color: black;">The preparations before the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TAVI Surgery in India</strong> </span>include the following:</span></em></p>
<p>● You will have a consultation with your doctor to know if you are the perfect candidate for the surgery.<br />
● A series of diagnostic tests are run to determine your overall health.<br />
● Based on your history, age, and overall health, the heart team decides if TAVI is the best option for you.<br />
● You will have to sign a consent form before the surgery.<br />
● Discontinue medicines that interfere with recovery after the surgery.<br />
● No liquid or solid food is allowed before the surgery. The fasting starts at midnight.<br />
● Maintain cleanliness and hygiene to avoid any infection in the body.<br />
● You will be informed about what to expect before, during, and after the procedure. You’ll learn about your hospital stay, discomfort, and recovery.<br />
● Psychological support is essential for medical procedures. Talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns, fears, and anxieties. You may also receive emotional support and counselling.<br />
● You must adhere strictly to the instructions leading up to the procedure. To proceed with TAVI, you should have all your questions answered.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the TAVI Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p><span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">●&nbsp;<strong>Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)</strong> replaces a damaged aortic valve with a tissue valve made from cow or pig heart tissues.</span><br />
● With TAVI, you don’t need to make a big incision down your chest as you would with surgical valve replacement (open-heart surgery).<br />
● At the start of the procedure, the doctor will make a small cut in one of three places:<br />
○ the groin<br />
○ the neck or<br />
○ a space between the ribs</p>
<p>● The doctor will then insert a catheter into a blood vessel and guide it into the heart.<br />
● The doctor places the catheter correctly using moving X-ray images or echocardiogram pictures.<br />
● Using a hollow catheter, a replacement valve made of cow or pig tissue is placed in the aortic valve area.<br />
● The catheter tip inflates to press in the new valve. Some valves don’t need balloons to expand.<br />
● Once the new valve is in, the doctor removes the catheter and closes the incision.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;">TAVI</span> involves carefully monitoring your vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the procedure</strong></span></h3>
<p>● After the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>TAVI surgery in Delhi</strong></span>, you will be taken to the recovery room.<br />
● The hospital stay after the surgery is for 1 to 2 days.<br />
● Follow the doctor’s instructions correctly for incision care.<br />
● Take your pain medications on time.<br />
● Make sure to attend follow-up visits to check the recovery and the working of the replacement valve.<br />
● You can also join cardiac rehab to retain your cardiac health.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery after TAVI Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>Keep a heart-healthy lifestyle as you recover and prevent further problems. When you’re done with <span style="color: black;">TAVR:</span><br />
● Make sure you don’t smoke.<br />
● Eat a healthy diet full of fruits and veggies and low in salt (sodium) and trans fats.<br />
● Get regular exercise – talk to your doctor before starting something new.<br />
● Keep a healthy weight.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits of TAVI Surgery in India</strong></span></h3>
<p>There are several benefits of the procedure when compared with <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>open heart surgery</strong></span>. The primary benefits include:</p>
<p>● It can be easily performed on people who have high surgical risk<br />
● Improve overall health and quality of life in people suffering from heart valve diseases.<br />
● Minimally invasive and requires a minimal incision.<br />
● Short hospital stay<br />
● Faster recovery time<br />
Risks associated with the procedure<br />
Every surgery comes with some risks. The common risks associated with the procedure are as follows:<br />
● Incision bruising, bleeding, or pain<br />
● An infection<br />
● Stroke or heart attack-causing blood clots<br />
● Arrhythmias, which in some cases require a pacemaker<br />
● Blood vessel damage caused by the catheter<br />
● Damage to the heart and blood vessels<br />
● Leaking of the replaced valve.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Clinical Outcomes</strong></span></h3>
<p>● According to the data from the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>National Health Library</strong></span>, the survival rate after TAVI is 89 %.<br />
● Less risk of cardiac-related deaths<br />
● Low risk of complications as compared to open heart surgery</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How long does a TAVI heart valve last?</strong></span></p>
<p>There’s still a lot of research to be done before we can say precisely how long TAVI valves last. In most cases, a TAVI valve still works well six years after surgery. It’ll probably get better as technology and technique improves.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why is India a Hub for TAVI Surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: black;"><em>India is now a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>global hub for medical tourism</strong> </span>because of the following:</em></span></p>
<p>● Affordability<br />
● Skilled surgeons and medical teams<br />

<p>Indraprastha Apollo hospital in India successfully carried out India’s first liver transplant in 1998. Since then, India has emerged as a global leader in solid organ transplants and over 2000 liver transplants are performed here annually. Nearly 3,200 patients from over 50 countries got their liver transplant done from the Apollo Institute of Liver Transplant in New Delhi, India.</p>
<p>Apollo’s Solid Organ Transplant Program is the world’s largest program and remains so for the last six consecutive years since 2014. The institute holds expertise in performing ABO incompatible and liver &amp; kidney transplant together.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is liver transplant?</strong></span></p>
<p>An adult liver transplant is a surgical procedure that involves replacing recipient’s recipient liver with the liver of a healthy donor.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When is liver transplant needed?</strong></span></p>
<p>Common indications for liver transplant are cirrhosis, acute liver failure, metabolic diseases, liver cancer, biliary atresia etc.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">When should liver transplant be performed?</span> </strong></p>
<p>When a liver is unable to perform its normal function resulting in complications such as coma, bleeding, and jaundice due to liver failure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is the success rate of liver transplant surgery in an adult?</strong></span></p>
<p>It depends on how early the transplant surgery is performed. Generally, 94% success rate can be achieved.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Does a patient need lifelong medication after the liver transplant?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, patient will need anti-rejection medicines lifelong, otherwise patient’s own immunity system will reject the donor liver.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Where does liver graft come from?</strong></span></p>
<p>The most feasible option is to get the graft for liver transplant from a live healthy family donor. On rare occasions, the patient can get liver graft from a brain-dead patient.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How much liver will be taken out from the donor?</strong></span></p>
<p>After matching the liver size with that of the recipient:</p>
<ul>
<li>35%, in case where left side is chosen as the graft liver</li>
<li>60-65%, in case where right side is chosen as the graft liver</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the risks for the liver transplant donor?</strong></span></p>
<p>There’s risk of death in 0.02% cases where there is infection. There is also a risk of injury in bile duct, leakage of bile, bleeding, etc.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the criterions for a matched living donor in liver transplant?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>The most important condition for a liver transplant donor is that s/he should come forward voluntarily without any coercion.</li>
<li>It must be clearly understood that there is a 10% risk of complication arising in the event of surgery.</li>
<li>Statistics suggest that there is a five-percent chance on recipient’s non-survival after liver transplant.</li>
<li>Donor should understand that there will be no financial gains for him/her.</li>
<li>The liver transplant donor has all the rights reserved to withdraw his / her consent from the liver transplant surgery at any point of time without assigning any reason whatsoever.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Do liver surgeries for both the donor and the recipient occur at the same time?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, the surgery is planned like that, in case the liver donor is alive. However, in case of a deceased donor, the liver transplant surgery can only be started once the liver is made available in the hospital where the surgery is scheduled to take place.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Do both donor and recipient require ICU stay after surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, both will be shifted in the special liver transplant ICU. Generally, 3-5 days of stay in ICU is sufficient for the donor and recipient, respectively.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When can a liver recipient get discharged from the hospital?</strong></span></p>
<p>Patient needs to stay in hospital for three weeks until the newly transplanted liver starts functioning properly and patient is strictly monitored for any complications that may arise.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When can a patient start eating normally?</strong></span></p>
<p>Soon after the surgery, the patient is put on a liquid diet. Once the liver starts giving indications that the liquid diet is well received, the patient would be switched to solid foods as the new liver starts to work appropriately.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is the meaning of ‘rejection of liver’ and what are ‘anti-rejection medicines’?</strong></span></p>
<p>‘Rejection of liver’ occurs when one’s body immunity system recognizes the new liver as a foreign body and starts damaging it as a natural defense mechanism. In order to avoid this rejection, doctors prescribe the patient with ‘anti-rejection’ or immunosuppressant medicines that should be consumed lifelong along with the anti-bacterial and viral medicines to prevent the rejection caused by low immunity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What could cause risks to a new liver after the transplant surgery?</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Return to alcohol, infections, or non-compliance of anti-rejection medicines may lead to graft failure</li>
<li>Primary and delayed graft non-functioning</li>
<li>Graft failure due to sepsis, recurrent disease</li>
<li>Return of liver cancer</li>
<li>Kidney failure</li>
<li>Bleeding in abdomen</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>As a patient of liver transplant, how can I take care of my health after surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p>You should see your physician regularly to monitor functioning of the new liver. This will include blood tests, ultrasound and other routine tests. Patient should eat healthy food, exercise and avoid alcohol, especially when alcohol was the initial cause of liver failure. Another important precaution is to avoid crowded places to minimize chances of infection. In case of infection, report to your treating physician immediately.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When can I resume my daily activities after liver surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p>This depends on how unwell you were before surgery, but yes, most patients go to work and resume normal daily activities. Your transplant doctor will guide you on recovery phase based on the findings of the performed clinical tests.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What dietary precautions do I have to consider post liver transplant?</strong></span></p>
<p>There is a possibility for the patient to gain weight or develop diabetes due to transplant medicines. Hence, it is advisable to take low-fat balanced diet to be able to stay fit.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How long should a patient from foreign country stay in India for the liver transplant?</strong></span></p>
<p>Liver transplant requires a minimum of two-month stay in India. The process of all types of solid organs’ transplantation in India is governed by an ‘Act’ and surgery can only be carried out once the Authorization Committee grants the written permission for the same. It takes minimum 15 days to seek this kind of approval from the committee in an ideal situation when all the statutory requirements are fulfilled. The patient is recommended to stay for atleast a month post-transplant to monitor the functioning of the newly transplanted liver so that the patient can travel back to their home country without hassle.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How long should a liver donor from foreign country stay in India?</strong></span></p>
<p>The donor could fly back to his / her home country after 10 days of surgery if the donation went uneventful.</p>

It is also known as a stem cell transplant. You will need a bone marrow transplant if your bone marrow has stopped working and does not produce healthy blood cells.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medihelp Global  is here with you to give you all the details of bone marrow transplants in India and tell you about the best hospitals and doctors offering this service in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>What is bone marrow?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A&nbsp; bone marrow is a spongy tissue that is found inside bones. It is where most of the blood cells are made. The blood cells that make other blood cells are called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">stem cells</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The most primitive of the stem cells is called the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">pluripotent stem cell</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. This is different from other blood cells with regard to the following properties:</span></p>
<p><b>Renewal.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is able to reproduce another cell identical to itself.</span></p>
<p><b>Differentiation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is able to generate one or more subsets of more mature cells.It is the stem cells that are needed in bone marrow transplants.</span></p>
<h2><b>What is Bone Marrow Transplant?&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bone marrow contains stem cells. In healthy individuals, stem cells help in the creation of :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Red blood cells that carry oxygen in our body</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">White blood cells that help our body fight infection</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Platelets that help to stop bleeding in our body</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If a bone marrow stops performing the above functions, then a person needs a bone marrow transplant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>What can a bone marrow transplant do?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The primary goal of bone marrow transplant is to cure different types of cancer. There are times when a person requires high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. These doses are so high that the bone marrow stem cells get destroyed. You will need a bone marrow transplant in the following cases:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replaced diseased and non-functioning bone marrow with a healthy one</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regenerate a new immune system that will fight the cancer cells; chemotherapy can’t kill</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Replace bone marrow to restore its normal function after a high dose of chemo and radiation therapy</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What diseases can be treated by Bone Marrow Transplant?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aplastic Anemia,</span></li>

<h2><b>Understanding Types of Bone Marrow Transplant</b></h2>
<h3><b>Type 1: Autologous Stem Cell Transplant</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this type of bone marrow transplant in India, your stem cells are harvested. They are removed from your bone marrow or your blood and then they are frozen. After you get high doses of chemo, your stem cells are given back to you. It is used in the treatment of:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leukaemia</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymphoma</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple myeloma</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple sclerosis</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crohn’s disease</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lupus</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Advantage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: In this type of transplant, since you get your stem cells back, there are no chances of reaction or rejection. This is also known as graft versus host disease.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Type 2: Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This type of bone marrow transplant uses donor stem cells. The best kind of donor is your close family member, your brother or sister. If you do not get a good match in your family, then you can find a donor in the general public via the national registry.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It works the same way. The stem cells are collected from the donor, stored, and frozen. After you get high doses of chemo or radiation therapy, the donor stem cells are given to you. It is used to treat:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Leukaemia</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lymphoma</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Multiple Myeloma</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Aplastic Anemia, a type of bone marrow disorder</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Type 3: Umbilical Cord Transplant</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a type of allogeneic bone marrow transplant. In this, stem cells are detached from a newborn baby’s umbilical cord just after the broth of the baby. The stem cells are frozen and stored until they are required for transplant. Umbilical cord blood cells have not matured enough, so blood count takes a long time to recover.</span><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Advantage of Allogenic Stem Cell Transplant: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A very major benefit of an allogenic transplant is that donor stem cells can make their open immune cells which could kill any cancer cells that remain even after chemo and radiation therapy. This is called the graft vs cancer effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donors can also be asked to donate more stem cells if needed in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Type 4: Half Matched Transplants</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is also known as a haploidentical transplant. It uses the stem cells of the donor, who shares half the genetic markers with the recipient. It can be a child, parent, or sibling. In this type of transplant, the donor and the recipient share the same genes, so the chances of a successful transplant increase.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Advantage</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The half-matched transplants reduce the chances of graft rejection. Graft rejection typically happens when the recipient’s immune system fails to recognize the donor cells and tries to kill them as a virus or bacteria. That is why it is vital to find the closest match possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b>Understanding HLA Match</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many factors decide how the immune system plays a role in determining the difference between self and non-self. Human Leukocyte Antigen Systems are proteins that are found on the surface of most cells. Each person has a certain number of pairs of HLA antigens. We inherit it from our parents, and then our children get it from us. Doctors try to match these antigens while finding a donor for a bone marrow transplant.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A match occurs when 6 of the known pairs of HLA antigens match. This reduces the chances of graft versus host disease, as mentioned above.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Finding The Right Match</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As already told, HLA antigens are inherited from both the parents. The search for the donor starts with siblings who have the same parent as you. The chance that any one sibling would be a perfect match is 1 on 4.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the sibling does not match, then the search moves to relatives, half siblings or aunts, uncles, and cousins. If they also do not match, then the doctors extend their search to the general public.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Understanding the Process of Bone Marrow Transplant in India</b></h2>
<p><b>Preparation of Recipient:&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the transplant, an extensive evaluation is carried out by the BMT team.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A complete medical history and physical examination are performed to evaluate the working of the vital organs.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A patient has to come 10 days before the transplant for placement of the central venous line and other preparations as well.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Preparation for Donor</b></p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Donor sources can be the self, a sibling, a parent, a relative, or anyone from the general public.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the donor is identified, they have to undergo specific tests to determine their overall health.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The stem cells are collected by bone marrow harvest.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>How are stem cells collected?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<p><b>The stem cells are collected in two ways:&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Peripheral Blood Stem Cells: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this process, blood is taken from one vein and circulated through a machine that removes the stem cells and returns the remaining blood and plasma to the donor through a needle inserted in the other arm. Several sessions are needed to collect the stem cells.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Bone Marrow Harvest: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It involves collecting stem cells via a needle placed in the soft center of the bone. Most sites for bone marrow harvesting are located in hip bones, and the donor will be under anesthesia during harvest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Note: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the donor is the person, it is called an autologous bone marrow transplant. If an autologous transplant is planned, previously collected stem cells from either peripheral (apheresis) or harvest are counted, screened, and ready to infuse.</span></p>
<h3><b>Bone Marrow Transplant Procedure</b></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The treatment starts with high doses of chemo or radiation therapy. The bone marrow makes blood cells in our body. Ablative therapy prevents the production of blood cells and makes bone marrow empty. Empty bone marrow makes room for new stem cells to grow.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After chemo, a bone marrow transplant is given via a central venous catheter. The process is the same as blood transfusion. The stem cells will find their way to the bone marrow and begin producing new cells.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the transplant, supportive care is given, like frequent blood tests, monitoring vitals, and providing a rigorous and clean environment to avoid any infection.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>What will happen after the transplant?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will spend several weeks in the hospital.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to protect yourself from infection.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can experience excessive bleeding.</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will need blood transfusions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1" style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have to take medicines to prevent graft vs host disease.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After leaving the hospital, the recovery process continues for several months. You must attend regular follow up visits with your doctor to track your process.&nbsp;</span></p><ol>

In such situations, it is normal to feel chaotic and confused. We are there to help all such parents and kids who are seeking pediatric liver transplant&nbsp; assistance in India.</p>
<p>With 302 successful liver transplants in children till date, India-based Apollo hospital is leading from the front in pediatric liver transplant. The hospital has proven skills to carry out liver transplant surgery on babies weighing up to 4 kgs. With specialist doctors and world-class medical facilities that are also relatively cost effective, hospitals in India are fast becoming the chosen destinations for parents across the world if their kids require a liver transplant. Please read the following FAQs related to carrying out a liver transplant in India for children.</p>
<p><strong>What is a pediatric liver transplant?</strong></p>
<p>This is a surgical procedure that replaces the unhealthy liver of a child with that of the healthy donor liver.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if a child requires a liver transplant? </strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, two to eight weeks after birth, infants develop a rare liver disease called Biliary Atresia which is followed by acute liver failure and metabolic diseases for liver transplant. This calls for liver transplant in a child.</p>
<p><strong>How do doctors usually determine if a child needs a liver transplant?</strong></p>
<p>Doctors look for a complete clinical evaluation of the expert transplant team before confirming whether the child needs liver transplant or not.</p>
<p><strong>How can I arrange a donor liver that matches my child’s requirement?</strong></p>
<p>There are two options: first is to get the liver from a brain-dead patient, although a very rare option. Second and the most feasible option is to find liver donor from within the family itself.</p>
<p><strong>How does a doctor determine liver donor’s fitness for the purpose?</strong></p>
<p>They usually recommend parents with compatible blood group and free from any pre-existing medical conditions to be a potential donor.</p>
<p><strong>What all tests are required to be done before the transplant?</strong></p>
<p>‘HLA typing’ determines relationship between donor and recipient. Patient will also require performing a general body check-up, especially CT angiography of abdomen to understand the blood supply in liver.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to produce the immunization records of my child?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, vaccination records are essential as some vaccines can’t be given after transplant.</p>
<p><strong>What happens to the donor liver after surgery?</strong></p>
<p>Fortunately, liver is the only organ in the body that has a tendency to regrow, so donor liver regenerate itself to its normal shape after 8-12 weeks.</p>
<p><strong>What is the advantage of living donor transplant?</strong></p>
<p>It’s always a planned surgery without much risk to donor or recipient.</p>
<p><strong>How long will the donor and patient have to stay in the hospital?</strong></p>
<p>The donor gets discharged in a week, whereas the patient needs to stay around three weeks in the hospital depending on full recovery.</p>
<p><strong>By when can a donor start performing regular day-to-day activities?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, donors are advised bed rest for at least three months to recover completely.</p>
<p><strong>What is the duration of a liver transplant surgery?</strong></p>
<p>Patient’s surgery takes ~8-12 hours, whereas the donor’s surgery can take upto 5 hours.</p>
<p><strong>What are the risks involved in the liver transplant surgery?</strong></p>
<p>Some common yet treatable complications may occur such as bleeding, blood clotting disorders and infections. However, rejection of liver from patient’s own immune system is a major problem and may call for another transplant.</p>
<p><strong>Does my child need to stay in ICU?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, your child needs special liver transplant ICU for more than a week based on recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Does my child need lifelong medications?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the patient will need anti-rejection medicines lifelong otherwise patient’s own immunity will reject the donor liver.</p>
<p><strong>What happens in case my child misses out on medication for any reason?</strong></p>
<p>In that case, you will have to contact us for further guidance.</p>
<p><strong>As a family of the patient from different country, how long do we have to stay in India after transplant</strong>?</p>
<p>A patient will need twice a week examination post transplantation by the transplant team of doctors till your child recovers fully. Hence, at least a stay of two months post-transplant is recommended.</p>
<p><strong>Who will follow up on my child in my home country?</strong></p>
<p>Local pediatrician can manage your child in your home country supported by our transplant team via emails.</p>
<p><strong>What are the precautions to be taken post-transplant?</strong></p>
<p>Avoid heavy activities and crowed places to prevent infection for six months.</p>
<p><strong>Can my child live a normal healthy life after transplant?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, a healthy routine life has been achieved by most patients after successful liver transplant. Patient can attend school and other sports activities after six months of the liver transplant.</p>

<p><strong>What all documents needed prior to organ transplant in India?</strong></p>
<p>In India, solid organ transplantation is regulated by a law known as Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. This Act is enacted to prevent medical ethics and commercialization of human organs. All major Indian hospitals like Fortis, Apollo, Max, Medanta, Artemis and BLK have statutory licenses to carry out human organs transplantation in accordance of the Act. This acts permits transplants only when donor and recipient meet certain criterion, monitored by transplant Authorisation committee set up by Govt. of India. The Patients are advised to go through the table below very carefully, properly compile all duly attested documents before traveling their home country /coming to India. The Authorization Committee may not grant permission to carry organ transplant surgery in case of any discrepancy observed by the Authorization Committee in your documents. Other set of documents are compiled by the hospital legal cell on your arrival.</p>
<p><strong>Who is close relative donor?</strong></p>
<p>It means grandparents, parents, spouse, sibling, children and grandchildren of donor only. In case of married donors, close relative donor would mean husband or wife.</p>
<p><strong>Who is 1st degree related donor? </strong></p>
<p>1st Degree Related means grandparents, parents, children, siblings and grandchildren only.</p>
<p><strong>Who is distant relative or unrelated donor?</strong></p>
<p>Distant Relative means cousin, In laws, Niece, nephew, brother/sister in law, All others fall in unrelated donor category.</p>
<p>Suitability of Donor would be decided by transplant surgeon as per the Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994 (THOA), the donor should be above 18 years of age.</p>
<p>If the donor is unmarried then one consent form is to be made in prescribed format from mother and father of donor duly attested by the concerned Embassy/High Commission (Annexure -1 ), In addition to their ID card and documentary link. If the Donor is married, the consent affidavit needs to be provided by both the spouse (husband/wife as applicable) AND parents (either father or mother) along with photograph attested by the concerned Embassy/High Commission (Annexure -1), In addition to their ID card and documentary link.</p>

			<p><strong>Kidney Transplant Surgery</strong> is a procedure in which a healthy kidney from a living or deceased donor is surgically implanted into a patient’s body. The success of kidney transplant surgery mainly depends on donor and recipient (patient) compatibility.</p>
<p>India has many world-class JCI-accredited hospitals carrying out <strong>cost-effective kidney transplant programs,</strong> including robotics which increases the chances of successful kidney transplants. Furthermore, the Indian Government has implemented regulations and laws for ethical <strong>Kidney Transplants in India</strong>, providing a sense of safety to the patient and donor.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Legal Documentation required before Kidney Transplantation </strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Kidney Transplant in India </strong>is governed by The Transplantation of Human Organs Act of 1994. It aims to promote the humanitarian benefits of organ transplantation while preventing exploitation and abuse. Therefore a patient has to submit several documents to the authorization committee set up by Govt of India as a part of the eligibility criteria. These include medical and diagnostic tests of the patient as well as for the donor.</p>
<p>Apart from this, the patient and the donor must provide proof of relation, identity, address, income, and age in the form of a Government-issued ID, like a passport. You will also have to submit a no-objection certificate from the donor’s spouse or close relative, with consent signed by you and the donor.</p>
<p>We advise you to check with the hospital for additional or specific document requirements before traveling to India, to ensure smooth and successful kidney transplant procedure. The Authorization Committee may not grant permission to carry out kidney transplant surgery in case of any discrepancy observed in your documents</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Donor Selection Criteria:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The donor’s age should be between 18 and 55 years.</li>
<li>He should be free of any medical conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and viral hepatitis (B or C).</li>
<li>The donor’s blood type should ideally be the same as the recipient’s (ABO compatible)</li>
<li>To reduce the risk of transplant rejection, the donor and recipient should have a good Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibody tissue match.</li>
<li>The donor must be a close relative of the patient, preferably a blood relative.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Investigations of Kidney Transplant Donor:</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hepatitis B &amp; C</li>
<li>HIV I &amp; II</li>
<li>CBC, LFT, KFT and blood group,</li>
<li>Cross-matching in case of ABO compatible</li>
<li>Anti – ABO antibody Titer in case of ABO-incompatible</li>
<li>Random blood sugar, HBa1C</li>
<li>USG Whole abdomen</li>
<li>Urine Routine &amp; Microscopic</li>
<li>Psychological evaluation and assessment</li>
<li>Evaluation of the donor’s medical history</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The procedure of a Kidney Transplantation &nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<p>Kidney transplantation in a donor can be performed in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traditional open surgery</li>
<li>Laparoscopic surgery or</li>
<li><strong>Minimally invasive robotic kidney transplant surgery</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the case of conventional open surgery, the surgeon makes a large incision in the lower abdomen of the donor to access the kidney.</p>
<p><strong>Robotic-assisted kidney transplantation</strong> is a precise, minimally invasive surgery that uses robotic technology to assist the surgeon in performing the transplant. During the process, the surgeon makes a small incision of about 7 to 10 cm to remove the kidney from the donor.</p>
<p>One of the robotic arms holds a high-magnification 3D camera which is inserted into the abdomen through one of the keyholes and provides a high-definition, magnified (12×), 3D view of the surgical site. The other mechanical arms are equipped with surgical instruments designed to mimic the movement of the human hands and wrists.</p>
<p>Once the kidney is removed from the donor, the surgeon will transplant it into the recipient.&nbsp; Depending upon its condition, the surgeon may or may not remove the existing kidney.</p>
<p>The surgeon controls the robotic instruments from a console, which allows for greater flexibility compared to traditional open surgery. The robotic procedure has various advantages over traditional surgery.&nbsp; But robotic kidney transplantation also has limitations like higher cost, the need for specially trained surgeons, and, most notably, the surgery is unsuitable for all patients.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Limitations of Robotic Kidney Transplant </strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Cost</li>
<li>It is time taking procedure hence chronic debilitated patients are not a candidate for this procedure</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>ABO incompatible kidney transplant</strong></span></p>
<p>When the recipient and the donor have different blood groups, this procedure is necessary. Previously, the only option was to find a compatible match donor because the presence of blood antibodies that reacted with the donor’s blood type would cause the transplant to be rejected. However, the availability of ABO incompatible kidney transplants between specific receivers and living donors has resulted in shorter waiting times for many patients due to medical advancements.</p>
<p>Patients receiving an ABO incompatible kidney transplant get pre- and post-transplant medical care to lower the risk of rejection and guarantee a successful transplant.</p>
<p>Plasmapheresis and plasma exchange prevents the body from attacking the transplanted kidney by removing harmful antibodies and other chemicals from the blood plasma. Thus, ensuring proper functioning of the transplanted kidney.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Role of anti-rejection medicine after transplant</strong></span></h2>
<p>The body’s immune system cannot reject a donated kidney if anti-rejection medicine is used. The new kidney can operate normally because these medications suppress the immune system, which stops it from attacking the transplanted organ. Anti-rejection medicine must be adequately managed for a kidney transplant to be effective.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Factors Affecting the Cost Of Kidney Transplant in India</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A kidney transplant is a surgical procedure in which a healthy kidney is removed from a healthy or deceased person and is transplanted into the person whose kidneys have stopped functioning. The procedure is typically considered when other treatment options like dialysis are not working.</span></p>
<p><strong>Here are the factors that affect the cost of kidney transplants in India:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><b>Type of Transplant: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A living donor transplant is more expensive as compared to a deceased donor transplant because it involves the cost of surgery for both the donor and the recipient.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Procedure Type – Robotic </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">assisted kidney transplant and laparoscopic donor surgery is more expensive than traditional kidney transplant surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>ABO Incompatible Transplant : </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The availability of ABO incompatible kidney transplants has resulted in shorter waiting times for many patients due to medical advancements. Plasma exchange prevents the body from attacking the transplanted kidney by removing harmful antibodies and other chemicals from the blood plasma. Due to plasma exchanges, the transplant procedure becomes costly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of Hospital you choose: </b><b>Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of kidney transplant&nbsp; in India increases if:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital is JCI-accredited</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital has advanced super speciality kidney transplant facilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand image of the hospital (Indraprastha Apollo, Fortis Hospital, etc.)&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Hospital Stay Period and Room Category: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients requiring longer or a higher room category must pay more for the treatment. ICU charges also add to the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Age of the patient: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Older patients require more medical care and additional tests before and after the surgery. Thus, their treatment cost is high.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Organ Transportation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It includes retrieval and transportation of the kidney ( if Applicable)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Surgeon Fee</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The cost of a kidney transplant in India greatly depends on the surgeon’s fees, too. The surgeon’s fee depends on the following:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reputation and skill of the surgeon</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon is affiliated with reputable hospitals and medical institutions known for their expertise in kidney transplant</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">No. of successful procedures performed&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">International education and training&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Medical Evaluation: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the transplant surgery, the donor and the recipient must undergo a series of medical tests, evaluations and consultations. This adds to the overall cost of the surgery. Lab Tests like X-Ray, ECG, and other tests add to the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Donor Investigations: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of a kidney transplant in India also includes the donor’s medical care donors, medical testing, hospital stay, travel expenses, etc.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Immunotherapy and Anti-Rejection Medicines: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the transplant, you have to take immunosuppressant medicines for the rest of your life. The cost of these medicines will depend on the treatment’s type, dosage and duration.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Complications During the Treatment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In some cases of kidney transplant, additional complications may arise, which may need further surgeries. This will increase the overall cost of the surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Other Expenses: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additional costs due to the presence of any other health condition</span></p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Corneal Transplant Surgery in India: Restoring Vision</span></h2>
<p>A corneal transplant surgery is an operation that is performed to replace the cornea with the corneal tissue from a donor. It is also called keratoplasty. The cornea is a transparent dome-like structure letting light enter the eye. It plays a major role in the eye’s ability to see.<br>
A person must undergo corneal transplant surgery if they have a damaged cornea. Corneal damage may lead to blurred vision and eye pain. Here, we will learn about corneal transplant surgery and how it is carried out in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How does the cornea become diseased?</strong></span></p>
<p>Many problems cause damage to the cornea. Some of the major reasons include:<br>
● Keratoconus is a condition in which the cornea becomes cone-shaped and leads to blurred vision.<br>
● Endothelial Decompensation: In this condition, the cornea becomes swollen.<br>
● Scarring: the cornea becomes scarred due to inflammation in the eye.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other conditions that can be treated with cornea transplant surgery include:</strong></span></h2>
<p>● Thinning or tearing of cornea<br>
● Fuchs Dystrophy, a genetic condition<br>
● Complications caused by previous eye surgery<br>
● Corneal ulcers</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Corneal Transplant Surgeries Performed in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>With the advancement in medical technology, the entire cornea or only part of it can be replaced depending on the damage. The different types of cornea transplant surgeries include:</p>
<p>● Endothelial Keratoplasty: In this type of surgery, the inner layer of the cornea is replaced with the healthy cornea of the donor. This is mainly used to treat patients suffering from Fuchs dystrophy.<br>
● Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty: In this surgery, the outer layer of the damaged cornea is replaced with a healthy outer layer of the donor cornea. It is used to treat people suffering from keratoconus.<br>
● Penetrating Keratoplasty: The entire cornea is replaced with a healthy donor cornea in this surgery. It is done when all the layers of the cornea have gone opaque.<br>
● Keratoprosthesis: It involves replacing the entire cornea with an artificial cornea. This procedure is used when a cornea is so severely damaged that it cannot be repaired with a natural donor or when a previous donor cornea transplant has failed.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Preparation</strong></span></h2>
<p>You’ll have to do these things before your cornea transplant:<br>
● An eye exam: During surgery, the eye doctor will look for conditions that might cause complications.<br>
● Eye measurements.: Eye measurements are done to get a donor cornea that fits your eye.<br>
● A review of all your medications and supplements: Some medicines or supplements might need to be stopped before or after the transplant.<br>
● Other eye problems: You might not be able to get a cornea transplant if you have unrelated eye problems. Those problems will be treated before surgery by your eye doctor.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Finding a cornea donor</strong></span></h2>
<p>Corneas used in transplants come from deceased people. Using corneas from people who died from unknown causes is not allowed. The corneas of people with previous eye surgery, eye disease, or certain conditions, like diseases passed from one person to another, aren’t used either.<br>
In contrast to liver and kidney transplants, cornea transplants don’t require tissue matching. India has many donor corneas, so there is a short waiting list.</p>
<p>Knowing Cornea Transplant Surgery in Detail</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>Before undergoing cornea transplant surgery, it is important to be prepared physically and mentally. Here are some key steps that are taken before the surgery:<br>
● Make sure to provide a detailed medical history to your doctor so that he may know about any of your pre-existing health conditions.<br>
● It would be best to undergo a series of tests to determine eye shape, size, and thickness. This will help the surgeon determine the appropriate donor cornea.<br>
● Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of the surgery.<br>
● Follow your doctor’s instructions if you need to continue or stop any medicines.<br>
● Maintaining good health before the surgery by eating a balanced diet and staying hydrated.<br>
● Quit smoking and drinking before the surgery.<br>
● You will need someone to take you back home after the surgery as you cannot drive.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>● The corneal transplant surgery is performed as an outpatient procedure.<br>
● You will be positioned carefully on the operating table.<br>
● Local anesthesia is given through eye drops or injections to numb the eye. In some cases, general anesthesia is also used, especially for children with specific medical conditions.<br>
● The eye surgeon will choose how to transplant the healthy donor cornea based on your specific needs:<br>
● In some cases, the surgeon removes the circular part of the cornea and replaces it with a matching donor cornea.<br>
● Occasionally, surgeons remove only a thin layer from the front of the cornea and replace it with donor tissue.<br>
● In other cases, only the damaged inner layer of the cornea is removed, and healthy donor tissue is placed on the back surface of the cornea. An air bubble is then put in the eye to push this new layer of cells into its palace so the cornea can heal properly.<br>
● The surgeon uses sutures to place the cornea in place.<br>
● These sutures are tiny and heal in some months.<br>
● After the surgery, your eye will be bandaged to prevent injury and promote healing.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>● You will be taken to the recovery area, and you will be closely examined to make sure that there are no further complications.<br>
● You’ll get medicines. Medications can help with swelling, pain, and infection. You can prevent cornea rejection using eye drops that suppress your immune system.<br>
● Make sure you wear eye protection. Protect your eye while it heals with an eye shield or glasses.<br>
● Lay on your back. You might have to do this after surgery, depending on the type. It keeps the new tissue in place.<br>
● Keep yourself safe. Take it easy after your cornea transplant. Work your way up to your usual activities, including exercise, when your eye doctor approves. Make sure you don’t rub or press on your eye.<br>
● You’ll have to take extra precautions to keep your eyes healthy for the rest of your life.<br>
● Keep coming back for follow-ups. You’ll have to see your eye doctor regularly for a year after surgery. Your progress will be monitored, and complications will be looked for.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits of the surgery</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The benefits of cornea transplant surgery include: </strong></span></h3>
<p>● Clear Vision<br>
● Pain relief<br>
● Restoration of overall eye health<br>
● Correction of astigmatism<br>
● Enhanced quality of life<br>
● Safe procedure with a low completion rate<br>
● It can be performed on any age group, from older people to children</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks with the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>The biggest concern with cornea transplants is rejection. Rejection means your immune system identifies the donated cornea as foreign and rejects it. The risk of rejection varies depending on the surgical technique used and the condition of your eye.</p>
<p>Your eye can reject a transplanted cornea, so your surgeon may recommend against surgery. Eye infections and severe dry eyes increase rejection chances.</p>
<p>You’ll need to use eye drops for at least a year to reduce the risk of rejection after a cornea transplant.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>A cornea transplant can also cause these complications:</strong></span></h3>
<p>● An infection inside or on the cornea.<br>
● Bleeding.<br>
● Increased pressure inside your eye (glaucoma).<br>
● Corneal fluid leakage.<br>
● Retinal detachment.<br>
● Problems with your vision because of an irregular corneal curve.<br>
● An endothelial transplant held in place by an air bubble can detach.<br>
● Cataract</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Results of the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>Most people who get corneal transplant surgery get their vision back after the surgery. The results of the surgery also depend on your health. The risk of cornea rejection continues for years after the surgery. Therefore, please make sure to continue the follow-up appointments with your surgeon. The cornea rejection can be managed by medicines easily.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Correction of vision after surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>The first few days after surgery, your vision might be worse. The new cornea needs time to adjust. It can take a while for your vision to improve.</p>
<p>You’ll have to wait a few weeks or months for the outer layer of your cornea to heal. Your eye doctor will make adjustments to improve your vision after it heals, like:</p>
<p>● Getting rid of uneven corneas. Your cornea might look weird because of the stitches that hold the donor cornea in place. It can cause astigmatism. Astigmatism can blur your vision. Astigmatism might be treated by releasing some stitches.<br>
● Fixing vision problems. Refractive errors, like nearsightedness and farsightedness, can be corrected. Your eye doctor may recommend glasses, contact lenses, or laser surgery.</p>

<p><strong><u>What is Breast Conservative and Oncoplastic Surgery in India&nbsp;&nbsp; </u></strong></p>
<p>Surgical treatment of breast cancer has undergone a huge change from what it used to be about 40 years ago. Those patients, who are suitable for breast conservation surgery upfront or become suitable for the same after chemotherapy +/- targeted treatment, can opt for the same after a clear discussion with their surgeon.</p>
<p>What has made breast conservation surgery even better is Oncoplastic surgery, which allows us to restore shape to the breast after removing a part of it. While breast conservation surgery improves quality of life, improves body image and restores patients’ confidence, it has also shown to improve survival. One must, however, remember that breast conservation surgery has to be always accompanied by radiation therapy.</p>
<p>For women who are not keen on conservation and want to have the breast removed surgically, they can opt for breast reconstruction with their own tissue from the abdomen or back or have a silicon implant assisted reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>What is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy – New technique to avoid swollen arms after surgery? </strong></p>
<p>The other advancement in surgery of breast cancer that has benefited a large number of patients is Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy (SLNB). Earlier, all lymph nodes in the armpit were removed as part of surgery, even in those who were clinically node negative. This procedure leads to the problem of arm swelling (lymphedema) in 20-25% patients. This can be quite distressing in about 10% of patients who develop this problem. With the advent of SLNB, which involves removing only those lymph nodes to which the disease is likely to spread first, in women with uninvolved nodes clinically, the incidence of arm swelling is less than 6%.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Factors that Affect Breast Cancer Treatment Costs in India</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast cancer occurs when the healthy cells of breast tissue change and may begin to grow out of control which can appear as a lump or mass within the breast tissue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you want to get the treatment of Breast Cancer in India, here are some of the factors affecting the cost of the treatment:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of breast cancer treatment in India increases if:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital is JCI-accredited</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital has advanced oncological facilities</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The brand image of the hospital (Indraprastha Apollo, Fortis Hospital, etc.)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hospital is private or government</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Location of the Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Location of the hospital plays a crucial role in deciding overall cost of the breast cancer treatment in India. The cost will be more in the metro cities of India like Mumbai or Delhi.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type and Stage of Cancer: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The type and the stage of the cancer significantly impacts the overall cost of the surgery. Early stage cancer requires less aggressive treatment as compared to advanced stage cancer. The more advanced the stage of the cancer is, the more are the costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Experience of the surgeon: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon’s expertise and skill performing the surgery also affect the overall cost of breast cancer treatment in India. Surgeons who are board-certified and have a high success rate in the same field charge more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Diagnostic Tests: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Breast cancer evaluation requires several diagnostic tests like biopsy, FISH analysis, mammograms, ultrasounds, and genetic testing. The cost of these tests vary on their complexity and the labs in which they are performed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of Treatment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many times, the best option for breast cancer treatment involves more than one type of treatment. The average cost of these treatments vary from hospital to hospital.&nbsp;</span></p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Osteosarcoma Surgery in India: A Battle Against Bone Cancer</span></h2>
<p>Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in your bones. Initially, the cancer cells appear to be regular bone cells, but afterward, they create tumours and tumours create diseased bones. The cancer most often affects long bones like those in arms and legs. It primarily occurs near the end of your bones and near the knee, where the growth of the cancer occurs the fastest.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The most commonly affected areas by osteosarcoma are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Thigh Bone<br>
● Shin Bone<br>
● Upper Arm Bone<br>
● Organs in your abdomen or chest</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other less common areas where osteosarcoma can&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #008000;"><b>occur:</b></span></span></p>
<p>● Pelvis<br>
● Skull<br>
● Jaw</p>
<p>Here, we will discuss in detail osteosarcoma, the treatment options available for treating it, and why India is the best country to get the surgery done.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Osteosarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Osteosarcoma tumours can be categorized into three types:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Low grade<br>
● Intermediate<br>
● High Grade</p>
<p>Low grade means that the cancer will grow slowly and will remain where it began. On the other hand, a high-grade osteosarcoma indicates it will grow quickly and metastasize. Mostly, osteosarcoma that is found in children and teenagers is high grade.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk of getting Osteosarcoma?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>You are at a high risk of getting osteosarcoma if:</strong></span></p>
<p>● You have gone through a radiation treatment<br>
● You have a certain change in your RB1 gene<br>
● You are a teenager<br>
● You suffer from any of the following conditions like Bloom syndrome, Paget disease, Werner Syndrome<br>
● You suffer from Bone Infarct</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>The most common symptoms of osteosarcoma include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Pain is the most common symptom. The pain initially comes and goes but then it becomes constant.<br>
● Swelling or big lump in the affected area<br>
● If the tumour is in the leg, the person may start limping<br>
● Osteosarcoma weakens the bone and makes it fragile</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>To diagnose osteosarcoma, the doctors carry out two types of tests:</strong></span></p>
<p>Imaging Tests</p>
<p>Imaging Tests include:</p>
<p>● X-Ray<br>
● CT Scan<br>
● MRI Scan<br>
● PET Scan<br>
● Bone Scan</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Biopsy</strong></span></p>
<p>A biopsy is a procedure that is used to collect a sample of suspicious cells for lab testing. Tests show if the cells are cancerous or not. Types of biopsy done in osteosarcoma are:</p>
<p>● <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Needle Biopsy:</span></strong> in this doctor uses a thin needle to remove the small pieces of tissue from the tumor<br>
● <strong><span style="color: #008000;">Surgical Biopsy:</span></strong> In this, the doctor makes an incision through the skin to remove an entire or a portion of the tumor.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteosarcoma Treatment Options Available in India</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Osteosarcoma Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>The goal of the surgery is to remove all the cancer cells. The different operations used to treat osteosarcoma include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Limb Salvation / Sparing Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>In this surgery, the operation removes cancer, but the limb is pared so that its function can be maintained. The choice of this procedure depends on the extent of the cancer and how much muscle and tissue needs to be removed. If a section of bone is removed, then the surgeon will reconstruct the bone.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Amputation</strong></span></p>
<p>With the advancement in technology, though the chances of amputation have greatly reduced, amputation is performed when there is no other option available.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rotationplasty</strong></span></p>
<p>This surgery is used in growing children, where the surgeon removes the cancer area, including the knee joint. In Osteosarcoma surgery of the knee, the foot and the ankle are then rotated, and the ankle functions as a knee. A prosthetic is used for the lower leg and foot.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In chemotherapy, drugs are used to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy is often recommended in osteosarcoma before the surgery. If the cancer shrinks after chemotherapy, then a limb-sparing surgery is possible.</p>
<p>If osteosarcoma does not respond to chemotherapy, it means the cancer is very aggressive.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Radiation Therapy uses high-beam X-rays and protons to kill cancer cells. It is an option when surgery is not possible or the entire cancer cannot be removed during the operation. The beams are carefully directed to the area of osteosarcoma to reduce any damage to healthy cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>This therapy uses drugs to blog certain proteins that are necessary for cancer cells to grow. These drugs do not harm the normal cells.</p>
<p>Understanding Osteosarcoma Surgery in Detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The process begins with a thorough medical evaluation, which includes imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.<br>
● You will meet with multidisciplinary medical specialists such as orthopedic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists to discuss a treatment plan.<br>
● You have to undergo physical examination, blood tests, and possibly additional imaging to assess the extent of the tumor and its proximity to critical structures like nerves and blood vessels.<br>
● Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is often given to osteosarcoma patients before surgery. Using this treatment, the tumor is shrunk, making it easier to remove surgically.<br>
● The surgical team will plan the procedure carefully, taking into account the tumor’s location, size, and proximity to surrounding structures.<br>
● Your surgeon will discuss the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure with you in detail.<br>
● Your medical fitness for general anesthesia will be evaluated before surgery if general anesthesia is required.<br>
● The day before osteosarcoma surgery, you will receive instructions on fasting, medications to take or avoid, and preparations for surgery.<br>
● Emotional support can be helpful after a cancer diagnosis and surgery. For patients and their families, many medical centers offer counseling or support groups.<br>
● Transportation to and from the hospital, home care after surgery, and any necessary adaptations to your living space may be necessary.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● You have to undergo a thorough assessment before surgery, including imaging tests (such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans) to determine the size and location of the tumor.<br>
● In addition to blood tests, other diagnostic tests are conducted in order to assess the patient’s overall health.<br>
● General anesthesia is administered during the procedure to ensure unconsciousness and painlessness.<br>
● A surgical incision is made over the site of the tumor by the surgeon. An incision’s size and location will vary depending on the circumstances.<br>
● During tumor resection, the surgeon carefully removes the cancerous tissue, leaving a margin of healthy tissue behind. Some cases may require the removal of part of a bone or an entire limb, especially if the tumor is large or has spread to nearby structures.<br>
● In order to confirm the diagnosis and determine the characteristics of the tumor, a sample of the removed tumor tissue is sent to the pathology lab for examination.<br>
● A surgeon may perform bone reconstruction following the removal of a tumor. Several techniques can be used to accomplish this:<br>
○ A bone graft may be used to replace the bone that has been removed from the body or a donor.<br>
○ In order to preserve limb function, the surgeon may use a prosthesis or implant to reconstruct the affected bone.<br>
● A surgical incision is carefully closed with sutures or staples.<br>
● A drain may be placed near the surgical site in order to remove excess fluids and prevent swelling.<br>
● During the postoperative period, the patient is closely monitored in the recovery area. The patient receives pain management, antibiotics, and other supportive care measures.<br>
● Physical therapy is a crucial component of the recovery process. They assist patients in regaining mobility and function in their affected limbs.<br>
In addition to osteosarcoma surgery, chemotherapy may also be included in a comprehensive treatment plan before and after surgery. It is the goal of surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible as well as to achieve negative surgical margins in order to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Specific details of the surgery may differ depending on the individual case, so patients should discuss their treatment plan and surgical options with their physician.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteosarcoma surgery Afterwards</strong></span><br>
● You will have to stay in the hospital under close medical observation. The extent of the stay will depend on the type of the surgery.<br>
● Manage pain using the pain medications prescribed by the doctor after the surgery.<br>
● Follow proper instructions to take care of the wound after the surgery.<br>
● You will have to undergo physical therapy to regain mobility after the surgery.<br>
● Keep a close monitor on wound and pain management. This will help you to recover better.<br>
● Proper diet and nutrition are essential for effective recovery.<br>
● Attend regular follow-ups with your doctor to keep track of the recovery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of the Surgery</strong></span><br>
● The primary goal of the surgery is to remove the cancerous tumour.<br>
● It prevents tumour from spreading to other parts of the body.<br>
● The surgery helps to reduce pain and discomfort caused by the tumour.<br>
● The limb sparing technique aims to preserve as much limb function as possible.<br>
● Since osteosarcoma can weaken the bones, it makes us susceptible to fractures. The surgery can reduce the risk of fractures.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks Associated with the Osteosarcoma Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #000000;"><em>The risks associated with the surgery are: </em></span></strong><br>
● Bleeding<br>
● Blood clots<br>
● Infection<br>
● Pain<br>
● Skin breakdown<br>
● Long-term physical problems</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Ewings Sarcoma Treatment in India: Bridging Hope and Healing Through Treatment</span></h2>
<p>Ewings Sarcoma is a scarce type of tumor that grows in the bones. It usually affects patients aged between 10 to 20 years. The good news is that it can be cured. This cancerous tumor often develops during puberty and typically appears in the arms, legs, and pelvis.<br>
Thanks to ongoing research and new ewings sarcoma treatment&nbsp; treatment options available in India, people suffering from Ewings Sarcoma can now live cancer-free.</p>
<p>Here, we will provide you with every detail about Ewings Sarcoma and how you can get its&nbsp; treatment from India to avoid sky-rising medical bills.<br>
Let us first learn a bit more about Ewings Sarcoma:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Ewings Sarcoma:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There are three different types of Ewings Sarcoma:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Ewing Sarcoma of bone is the most common type. It usually appears in thigh bones, ribs, or shoulder blades. It can appear in any bone.<br>
● Soft Tissue Tumor affects the soft tissues of the bones. It can be found in the arms, legs, neck, chest, and abdomen.<br>
● Peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor is found in nerves and other parts of the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stages of Ewings Sarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p>● Localised Ewing Sarcoma<br>
● Metastatic Ewings sarcoma<br>
● Recurrent Ewing Sarcoma</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The primary signs and symptoms of Ewings Sarcoma include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Pain or swelling in the area where it is growing<br>
● Bone pain<br>
● Tiredness<br>
● Fever without any cause<br>
● Weight Loss<br>
● Broken bones without any injury</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Causes</strong></span></p>
<p>According to doctors, genetic mutation or change in the normal cells to Ewings Sarcoma cells is the primary cause of this disease. These cells, hence, multiply and create cancerous tumors in the bones.</p>
<p>There is no significant reason behind mutation. Doctors also think that it is the second cancer that develops in patients who have been treated with radiation for another type of cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></span></p>
<p>● You can develop Ewings Sarcoma at any age. But people who are between 10 and 20 years of age are at more risk.<br>
● It is more common in boys than in girls.<br>
● White people develop it more often than Blacks.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complications</strong></span></p>
<p>● Ewings Sarcoma can lead to metastatic cancer. It spreads from the original tumor to other areas that are extremely difficult to treat.<br>
● Ewings Sarcoma can return after initial treatment. It can come back within 5 years of the treatment.<br>
● Some people can develop side effects after its treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p>The following tests are done to diagnose Ewings Sarcoma:</p>
<p>Imaging</p>
<p>● X-Ray<br>
● MRI<br>
● CT Scan<br>
● PET Scan<br>
● Bone Scan</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Biopsies</strong></span></p>
<p>● Needle Biopsy is done using a hollow needle to obtain cells, fluids, and tissues from the cancerous lumps.<br>
● Bone marrow aspiration is done to look out for cancerous cells in the liquid found inside the bone marrow.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Blood Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>● CBC<br>
● Comprehensive Metabolic panel<br>
● LDH</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the treatment options available?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The treatment will depend on several factors:</strong></span></p>
<p>● The size of the tumor<br>
● Where it has spread<br>
● Your overall health<br>
● Your preferences.</p>
<p>You have to talk to your healthcare provider in India about what treatment option you are comfortable with.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The treatment options include</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>It is the first line of treatment given by doctors in India. Chemotherapy coupled with medicines are used to kill the cancer cells and stop them from growing. The doctors here can use more than one type of chemotherapy at a time or combine it with surgery or radiation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>In this step, the doctors will try to remove the tumor to stop it from spreading. If, in some cases, the cancer has spread a lot, amputation is the ultimate resort.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In this treatment option, X-rays are used to kill the cancer cells. Since Ewings sarcoma can return after diagnosis and treatment, you have to be extremely careful.</p>
<p>It is essential to see a doctor if you notice any of the symptoms mentioned above.</p>
<p>Understanding Surgery in Detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The process begins with a thorough medical evaluation, which includes imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.<br>
● You will meet with multidisciplinary medical specialists such as orthopedic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists to discuss a treatment plan.<br>
● You have to undergo a physical examination, blood tests, and possibly additional imaging to assess the extent of the tumor and its proximity to critical structures like nerves and blood vessels.<br>
● The surgical team will plan the procedure carefully, taking into account the tumor’s location, size, and proximity to surrounding structures.<br>
● Your surgeon will discuss the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure with you in detail.<br>
● Your medical fitness for general anesthesia will be evaluated before surgery if general anesthesia is required.<br>
● The day before Ewings Sarcoma surgery, you will receive instructions on fasting, medications to take or avoid, and preparations for surgery.<br>
● Emotional support can be helpful after a cancer diagnosis and surgery. For patients and their families, many medical centers offer counseling or support groups.<br>
● Transportation to and from the hospital, home care after surgery, and any necessary adaptations to your living space may be required.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>The first stage in the treatment of Ewings Sarcoma is chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is used to treat its spread to the lungs. Surgery is the next treatment option after chemotherapy</p>
<p>● Surgery is performed under general anesthesia. You will remain unconscious during the surgery.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>● The surgery may involve the following things: </strong></span><br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Limb Sparing Surgery:</strong> </span>It is performed when the tumor is in the arm or leg. The doctors will remove the cancer and will spare the limb function. In some cases, artificial bone can be used to reconstruct the limb.<br>
●<span style="color: #339966;"><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;"> Amputation</span>:</strong></span> if the tumor is too large and has severely damaged the bone, amputation becomes necessary to remove all the cancer cells.<br>
●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Chest Wall Resection:</strong></span> When Ewings Sarcoma is in the chest, a small portion of the rib is removed along with the tumor. Reconstruction surgery follows then.<br>
● Surgeons also examine the surrounding lymph nodes. If cancer has spread to surrounding lymph nodes, then they are also removed.<br>
● If the surgery involves the removal of tissue, reconstruction surgery is performed to restore the form and function of the tissue.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● You will have to stay in the hospital after the surgery. The length of the stay will depend on the type of surgery.<br>
● Limb amputation surgery has more extended hospital stays as compared to limb-sparing surgery.<br>
● You will receive some pain medications. Take them on time to control pain and discomfort.<br>
● Keep your surgical wound clean to avoid any infection.<br>
● Rehabilitation is an essential part of the recovery process. You have to undergo physical therapy to restore limb function.<br>
● In some cases, chemotherapy is performed to kill the remaining cancer cells after the surgery.<br>
● Radiation therapy can also be a part of a treatment plan. It can help to destroy the remaining cancer cells.<br>
● After the surgery, you will have to undergo regular X-rays every six months.<br>
● You will have to take regular CT Scans of the lungs and periodic bone scans to detect recurrence.<br>
● You have to attend regular follow-up visits with your doctor to avoid Ewings Sarcoma cancer from returning.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ewing’s Sarcoma Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>The factors that affect prognosis are different before and after treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before any treatment is given, the prognosis depends on the following:</strong></span></p>
<p>● The location of the tumor.<br>
● How far the cancer has spread.<br>
● Size of the tumor when it’s diagnosed.<br>
● LDH level in blood.<br>
● If the cancer has specific gene changes.<br>
● Whether tumor DNA has been found in the blood.<br>
● Patient’s age.<br>
● Patient’s gender.<br>
● Whether the patient has had treatment for another cancer.<br>
● Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After treatment is given, the prognosis is affected by the following:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Whether the tumor was entirely removed by surgery.<br>
● The tumor’s response to chemotherapy or radiation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When cancer recurs after initial treatment, the prognosis depends on:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Whether the cancer came back more than two years after the initial treatment.<br>
● Whether the cancer came back where it first formed and in other parts of the body or whether the cancer came back in only one site.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complications</strong></span></p>
<p>● Ewings sarcoma can spread to other areas, which makes treatment and recovery difficult.<br>
● The treatment is aggressive. It can have both long-term and short-term side effects.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other potential complications include: </strong></span><br>
● Problems with organs and tissues<br>
● Mood swings and effect on mental health<br>
● Ability to think and learn<br>
● Ability to have children</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● Surgery will help to remove the tumor<br>
● Surgery will prevent the spread of cancer to nearby areas<br>
● Surgery may prevent limb amputation<br>
● Chemotherapy and Radiation therapy become more effective after the surgery<br>
● Surgery may alleviate pain and help to improve the overall quality of life</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Ewings Sarcoma </b><b>Survival</b><b> Rate and Recurrence</b></span></p>
<p>The recurrence happens a few years after the treatment. In most patients, it returns five years after the surgery.</p>
<p>Once cancer recurs, it becomes difficult to treat. The same chemotherapy drugs that were used before cannot be used again. However, with the advancement in technology, like targeted immunotherapies, the hope for its permanent cure has improved.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chondrosarcoma Treatment in India: Hope Shines Bright</strong></span></h2>
<p>Chondrosarcoma is a rare cancer that starts in the bones. It can also occur in soft tissues near bones. This cancer mostly occurs in the pelvis, hip, and shoulder.<br>
Initially, Chondrosarcoma grows slowly and may not cause any signs and symptoms first. Some types grow very fast and pose a high risk of spreading to other body parts. There are numerous options available for Chondrosarcoma Treatment , which involve surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>In this detailed article, we will tell you everything about this form of bone cancer, its treatment options available in India, and how you can avail quality treatment at the most affordable prices in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Different Types of Chondrosarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There are several types of Chondrosarcoma.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Clear Cell Chondrosarcoma:</strong> </span>It is primarily found in men aged between 30 to 50. They grow slowly and have rare chances of spreading to other body parts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Dedifferentiated Chondrosarcoma:</strong></span> This type starts as a typical chondrosarcoma, and then some parts change into high-grade sarcoma like Osteosarcoma or fibrosarcoma. It develops in older adults and grows faster than other types of Chondrosarcoma.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Mesenchymal Chondrosarcoma:</strong></span> It develops in younger adults. It also grows very quickly and has a high chance of coming back after the treatment.<br>
Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma: An extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma looks gelatinous and grows slowly.</p>
<p>To prevent local recurrence and distant metastases, it’s important to diagnose early and remove it completely.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chondrosarcoma in the shoulder:</strong></span> Chondrosarcoma of the shoulder is a rare but potentially aggressive bone cancer that requires surgical resection and, sometimes, shoulder joint reconstruction. To manage this tough condition, you need a quick diagnosis and a multidisciplinary approach.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Chondrosarcoma Grades</span></strong></p>
<p>Chondrosarcoma are given grades 1 to 3. The lower the grade, the less likely it is to spread.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Grade 1:</strong> </span>When the Chondrosarcoma is in stage 1, it grows slowest and is very unlikely to spread.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Grade 2:</strong></span> These intermediate chondrosarcomas are slightly more likely to spread to other body parts.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Grade 3:</strong> </span>These are high-grade chondrosarcomas and are likely to spread.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p>Chondrosarcoma grows slowly, so it does not show symptoms initially. When it grows, you may experience:<br>
● Increasing pain<br>
● A growing lump or swelling<br>
● Weakness and bladder control problems if the cancer passes to the spinal cord<br>
● Feeling pressure around the growing mass.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What causes Chondrosarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p>People having certain medical conditions have a high risk of developing Chondrosarcoma. These medical conditions include</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Enchondromas:</strong> </span>They are benign tumors. They are not cancerous. They can show up if you have problems like Mafucci syndrome or Ollier disease.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Multiple Exotoses System:</strong></span> They are multiple benign tumors that can disrupt bone growth and cause cancer.</p>
<p>If you have ever had high doses of radiation or cancer treatment, this can raise your odds, too.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis and Tests</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Physical Exam</strong></span></p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will check your body and ask questions about your symptoms and any illnesses in your family.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Imaging</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>To diagnose Chondrosarcoma, you will need the following tests: </strong></span><br>
● X rays<br>
● MRI<br>
● CT Scan<br>
● Bone Scans<br>
● PET Scans.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Biopsy:</strong></span></p>
<p>A biopsy is a procedure used to collect a sample of suspicious cells for lab testing. Tests show if the cells are cancerous or not. Types of biopsy done in Osteosarcoma are:</p>
<p>●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Needle Biopsy:</strong></span> In this, the doctor uses a thin needle to remove the small pieces of tissue from the tumor.<br>
●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Surgical Biopsy:</strong> </span>In this, the doctor makes an incision through the skin to remove an entire or a portion of the cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How is Chondrosarcoma treated in India?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Your Chondrosarcoma Treatment in India will depend on the following factors:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Your age, overall health, and medical history<br>
● Type of cancer and its stage<br>
● Location of cancer<br>
● Your tolerance to specific procedures and therapies<br>
● Your preference</p>
<p>The primary goal of treatment is to remove the lump or the mass and reduce its chances of returning.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chondrosarcoma Treatment Options</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>The surgery aims to remove cancer and some healthy tissue around it. The type of surgery will depend on the location of the cancer. Types of surgery include:</p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Scraping the cancer away:</strong> </span>Small chondrosarcomas that grow in arms and legs are treated via scraping. The surgeon uses a cold gas or chemical to kill the remaining cancer cells. It is also known as cryosurgery. The bone can be repaired using bone graft or bone cement if needed.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cutting the cancer:</strong> </span>Sometimes, chondrosarcomas require cutting away more bone to remove all the cancer. When Chondrosarcoma spreads in an arm or leg, it may be necessary to remove the entire limb. However, surgeons in India always try to save the limp whenever possible. For example, they might remove the affected bone, replace it, and reconstruct it. This is also known as limb salvage surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In chemotherapy, drugs are used to kill cancer cells. It is often not used in Chondrosarcoma because this type of cancer does not respond to chemo. However, some types of chondrosarcomas respond to chemotherapy. So, it can be taken as a treatment option.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Radiation Therapy uses high-beam X-rays and protons to kill cancer cells. It is an option when surgery is impossible or the entire cancer cannot be removed during the operation. The beams are carefully directed to the Chondrosarcoma area to reduce damage to healthy cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bone Grafts</strong></span></p>
<p>The surgeon uses real or artificial bones to repair and rebuild the affected bones.</p>
<p>Understanding Chondrosarcoma Surgery in Detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>BEFORE THE SURGERY</strong></span></p>
<p>● The process begins with a thorough medical evaluation, which includes imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.<br>
● You will meet with multidisciplinary medical specialists such as orthopedic surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and pathologists to discuss a treatment plan.<br>
● You must undergo a physical examination, blood tests, and possibly additional imaging to assess the extent of the tumor and its proximity to critical structures like nerves and blood vessels.<br>
● The surgical team will plan the procedure carefully, considering the tumor’s location, size, and proximity to surrounding structures.<br>
● Your surgeon will discuss the risks and benefits of the surgical procedure with you in detail.<br>
● Your medical fitness for general anesthesia will be evaluated before surgery if general anesthesia is required.<br>
● The day before surgery, you will receive instructions on fasting, medications to avoid, and surgery preparations.<br>
● Emotional support can be helpful after a cancer diagnosis and surgery. Many medical centers offer counseling or support groups for patients and their families.<br>
● Transportation to and from the hospital, home care after surgery, and any necessary adaptations to your living space may be required.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>DURING THE SURGERY</strong></span></p>
<p>● Firstly, on the day of the surgery, you will be given anesthesia to make sure that you remain unconscious during the surgery.<br>
● The surgeon will start by making an incision at the site of the tumor. The goal is to access the tumor by minimizing the damage to the healthy tissues.<br>
● The next step involves tumor resection. The surgeon will remove the tumor, which may involve excising the portion of bone, cartilage, or surrounding soft tissue.<br>
● After the removal, the area is reconstructed. It involves the use of bone grafts or prosthetics.<br>
● After reconstruction, the surgeon will close the incision with sutures and staples.<br>
● The removed tumor is then sent to a laboratory for further examination.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After The Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● After the surgery, you will be moved to the recovery room or ICU for close monitoring.<br>
● You will be closely monitored for pain. Pain medications will be provided to control pain after the surgery.<br>
● The surgical wound will be inspected regularly for infections.<br>
● As soon as you become stable, you will be started with physical therapy to regain mobility.<br>
● Proper nutrition is extremely important for healing.<br>
● You will be closely monitored for blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory function, etc.<br>
● You will be prescribed antibiotics to prevent further infection.<br>
● Further treatment will depend on the results of pathology.<br>
● You need to attend follow-up appointments with your surgeon. It is crucial to monitor recovery and plan additional treatments.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Side effects of surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>The common side effects of Chondrosarcoma treatment that is surgery are:</p>
<p>● Pain<br>
● Bleeding,<br>
● Infection<br>
● Skin sores<br>
● Vomiting.</p>
<p>There are ways to manage the side effects caused by chemotherapy and surgery. Please talk to your surgeon if you suffer from any side effects.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The benefits of chondrosarcoma surgery are: </strong></span><br>
● Tumor removal<br>
● Reduce the risk of further spread<br>
● Lowers chance of cancer recurrence<br>
● Surgery tries to preserve as much healthy tissue and bone as possible<br>
● Reduction in pain and symptoms<br>
● Long-term survival</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>Prognosis is how a disease will affect you long-term. Many things determine a person’s prognosis, such as:<br>
● The location of the tumor<br>
● You have cancer that has spread to other parts of your body<br>
● During surgery, how much tumor was removed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>It’s important to talk to your doctor about your prognosis.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chondrosarcoma Survival Rate and Recurrence</strong></span></p>
<p>The Chondrosarcoma survival rate of people is estimated by how they’ve done in the past. It’s hard to tell how accurate these rates are because there are so few CS patients.</p>
<p>A CS patient’s 5-year survival rate varies depending on the subtype. Different types of CS can grow more quickly or come back after they’ve been removed. There’s a lower survival rate if the tumor grows back, called recurrence, or spreads to other body parts.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Revolutionizing Care: Cutting-Edge Bone Cancer Treatments in India</span></h2>
<p>Bone cancer develops in bones. When cancer cells start growing in bones, they start harming normal bone tissue. The type of bone cancer will depend on the place from where it originates.<br>
Bone cancer is extremely rare and have a 1 percent chance of developing. Non-cancerous bone cancers are more common than cancerous ones.</p>
<p>Some types of bone cancers occur primarily in children, whereas some occur in adults. In this detailed post, we will delve into different types of bone cancers and how they are treated in India. We will also look into the cost of the treatment and the best doctors in India to get the cancer treated.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Bone Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There are four main types of bone cancers:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteosarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p>It is the most common type of bone cancer and usually develops where new bone tissues form. It can start in any bone, but it most commonly occurs in large bones of arms and legs. This type of cancer is mostly found in teenagers and adults.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ewings Sarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p>Ewings Sarcoma is a scarce type of tumor that grows in the bones. It usually affects patients aged between 10 to 20 years. The good news is that it can be cured. This cancerous tumor often develops during puberty and typically appears in the arms, legs, and pelvis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chondrosarcoma</strong></span></p>
<p>Chondrosarcoma is a rare bone cancer that starts in the bones. It can also occur in soft tissues near bones. This cancer mostly occurs in the pelvis, hip, and shoulder.<br>
Initially, Chondrosarcoma grows slowly and may not cause any signs and symptoms first. Some types grow very fast and pose a high risk of spreading to other body parts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Secondary Bone Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>In secondary bone cancer, the cancer in your bone starts somewhere else. For example, if lung cancer spreads to your bones, then that cancer is known as secondary bone cancer. These cancers are known as metastatic cancers. Cancers that commonly spread to bones are:</p>
<p>● Breast cancer<br>
● Prostate cancer,<br>
● Lung cancer</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stages of Bone Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>The stage of bone cancer is determined by its size and location. It also depends on whether cancer has spread to other areas in the body. There are four stages of bone cancer:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1</strong> </span>In this stage, the tumor is low-grade grade, and the cancer cells are localized.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2</strong></span> In this stage, the cancer cells are localized, but the tumor becomes high-grade.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong></span> The tumor is high-grade, and the cancer has spread to other areas in the same bone.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong></span> Cancer has spread from the bone to other body parts like the lungs or liver. This is the final stage of bone cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms of Bone Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The most common bone cancer symptoms are: </strong></span><br>
● Pain<br>
● Swelling in the area where the lump is formed<br>
● Difficulty in moving<br>
● Fatigue<br>
● Fever<br>
● Limping</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Less common signs of bone cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>● Easily broken bones<br>
● Weight loss</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>If you experience any of the symptoms above, you should contact a doctor for bone cancer treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bone cancer Symptoms in the leg</strong></span></p>
<p>● Dull, aching, and persistent pain in the leg<br>
● Swelling in the affected area of the leg<br>
● Bone cancer in the leg leads to fractures<br>
● Limited mobility in the leg<br>
● Weakness in leg</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What causes bone cancer?</strong></span></p>
<p>The exact cause of bone cancer is unknown, but a few factors that increase the chance of bone cancer in an individual are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Atypical Cellular Growth</strong></span><br>
It is already known that healthy cells continuously divide to replace old cells. After this process, they die. However, atypical cells continue living. They will start to form masses, and that mass will one day turn into tumors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Radiation therapy kills dangerous cancer cells in the body. However, osteosarcoma is found in people who undergo radiation therapy. High radiation may contribute to its recurrence.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chromosome mutations</strong></span><br>
Genetic mutations can also raise the risk of developing bone cancer. However, it is rare.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></span></p>
<p>The following people may be at risk of developing bone cancer:</p>
<p>● If you have a family history of cancer, especially bone cancer<br>
● If you have received radiation therapy in the past<br>
● If you have Paget’s disease, the bones break down and grow back atypically.<br>
● If you have multiple tumors in the cartilage,<br>
● If you have any one of the following syndrome-Bloom Syndrome, Rothmund Thomson Syndrome</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>You may have to undergo the following diagnostic tests to determine bone cancer:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Radionuclide Bone Scan<br>
● CT Scans<br>
● MRI Scans<br>
● PET Scans<br>
● X Rays</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Biopsy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Several different types of biopsies are performed:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fine Needle Aspiration:</strong> </span>In this, the doctor will extract a small amount of fluid from the bone tumor and send it to the laboratory for further investigation.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Core Needle Biopsy:</strong></span> In this, a large needle is used to extract more fluid.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Incisional Biopsy:</strong></span> The doctor will cut through the skin under general anesthesia to remove a small amount of tissue that is sent for further analysis.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Excisional Biopsy:</strong></span> The doctor will remove the entire tumor for further analysis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Grading</strong></span></p>
<p>● After the biopsy, medical professionals determine the grade of the tumor.<br>
● A high grade means the cells look more atypical under a microscope and may spread faster.<br>
● A low grade means cells appear similar to typical cells and will spread slowly.<br>
● Determining the grade helps doctors decide the best course of treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bone cancer treatment depends on:</strong></span></p>
<p>● The stage and grade of cancer as explained above<br>
● Your age<br>
● Your overall health<br>
● The size and the location of the tumor</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment 1:</strong></span> Medications</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Medications for bone cancer treatment include: </strong></span><br>
● Chemotherapy drugs<br>
● Pain medications to stop inflammation<br>
● Bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss and prevent its structure<br>
● Cytotoxic drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells<br>
● Immunotherapy drugs to encourage the immune system to kill cancer cells</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment 2:</strong></span> Limb Salvage surgery.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the surgery is to remove the cancerous tumor. In most cases, the entire tumor is removed, along with some healthy tissue around it. The surgeon will then replace the lost bone with some other bone from your body with material from a bone bank or a replacement made of hard plastic. This is known as limb salvage surgery<br>
.<br>
However, when the tumor is large and reaches your blood vessels and nerves, amputation becomes necessary.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment 3:</strong> </span>Radiation Therapy</p>
<p>Radiation Therapy uses high-beam X-rays and protons to kill cancer cells. It is an option when surgery is impossible or the entire cancer cannot be removed during the operation. The beams are carefully directed to the cancerous area to reduce damage to healthy cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment 4:</strong></span> Chemotherapy</p>
<p>Chemotherapy uses strong anti-cancer drugs delivered through a vein to kill cancer cells. This treatment works well in osteosarcoma and Ewing Sarcoma but is not an effective treatment option for Chondrosarcoma.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment 5:</strong> </span>Complementary therapy</p>
<p>Your doctor might add herbal treatments to your care plan. Alternative treatments must be carefully considered since some may interfere with chemotherapy and radiation.<br>
Complementary therapy can help relieve symptoms and improve your quality of life. Here are some other options:<br>
● Meditating<br>
● Exercise<br>
● Aromatherapy</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Is bone cancer painful?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bone cancer can be painful, and the level of pain experienced by an individual will depend on several factors. These factors are: </strong></span><br>
● Type of bone cancer<br>
● Stage of cancer<br>
● Location of tumor</p>
<p>Bone cancer pain varies from individual to individual. It is extremely important to identify the symptoms as soon as possible to manage bone cancer, including pain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>Bone cancers can be treated successfully. In many cases, the cancer never returns. However, a person has to undergo multiple surgeries to achieve this outcome.</p>
<p>Other people may need to continue treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy to keep the cancer at bay. These bone cancer treatments may continue indefinitely.</p>
<p>You must keep attending follow-up visits with your doctor to make sure that the cancer never returns. And if it does, the treatment can be started as soon as possible.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bone cancer survival rate</strong></span></p>
<p>When you’re first diagnosed with bone cancer, the location and stage of cancer play a big role in bone cancer survival rates.</p>
<p>When it comes to osteosarcoma, and Ewing’s sarcoma, whether or not the cancer has spread to other parts of the body is the biggest indicator.</p>
<p>Cancer that hasn’t spread has a 70-80% survival rate.</p>
<p>Regarding Chondrosarcoma, the outlook is often determined by its grade. It’s usually low grade, which has a 90 percent survival rate.</p>
<p>These are just general stats. Depending on your age and health, your outlook might look different. Keeping up with your treatment plan is the best thing you can do to increase your chances of recovery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How long can you have bone cancer without knowing?</strong></span></p>
<p>People can have bone cancer for a long time without knowing it. It depends on the type, where it is, the rate of growth, and their overall health. Some people notice symptoms early, but others may not see any symptoms until it’s too late.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Surviving Lung Cancer: India’s Advanced Treatment Options</span></h2>
<p>Lung cancer basically affects the lungs, which are two spongy organs inside your chest. The primary function of your lungs is to breathe, taking in oxygen when you inhale and releasing carbon dioxide when you exhale. Unfortunately, lung cancer is the leading cause of death worldwide.</p>
<p>If you, too, have lung cancer and are exploring treatment options, India should be at the top of your list. Here, we will let you know why India is the best country to get the treatment done and how you can avail of the best lung cancer treatment in India.</p>
<p>But let us first get into some details of what lung cancer is.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is lung cancer?</strong></span></p>
<p>Lung cancer is a disease that the uncontrolled division of your cells causes. Your cells typically decide to make more copies of themselves. But sometimes, they start dividing abnormally, thus creating masses and tumors that do not let your organs function properly.</p>
<p>The disease starts in your lungs, usually in the bronchi or alveoli ( small units of lungs where oxygen and carbon di oxide are exchanged) . Lung cancer is fatal, but effective diagnosis and treatment can improve the outlook.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of Lung cancer</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 1</strong></span>: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</p>
<p>It is the most common type of lung cancer, also known as NSCLC. Its subtypes are:</p>
<p>● Adenocarcinoma<br>
● Squamous cell carcinoma<br>
● Large Cell Carcinoma</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 2:</strong> </span>Small Cell Lung Cancer</p>
<p>This cancer is most often referred to as oat cell cancer. It grows and spreads faster than NSCLC. In most people, this type of lung cancer is diagnosed when it has spread beyond the lungs. Since cancer proliferates, it responds well to chemo and radiation therapy. It occurs mainly in heavy smokers and is less common than non-small cell lung cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Staging in Lung Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>The lung cancer staging determines how far the cancer has spread and how severe it is. The most basic form of staging is:</p>
<p>●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Localised:</strong> </span>When cancer is within a limited lung area<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Regional:</strong></span> When cancer has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes.<br>
●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Distant:</strong></span> When cancer has spread to other parts of the body</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Specific ways of staging NSCLC</strong></span></p>
<p>● Occult or Hidden: In this stage, the cancer does not appear in the scans, but cancerous cells appear in mucus.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 0:</strong></span> The abnormal cells are only in the top layers of the airway lining<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1:</strong></span> A tumor is present in the lungs, is 4 cm or under, and has not spread to other body parts.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2:</strong></span> A cancer is 7 cm or under and has spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong></span> The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and has reached other parts of the lungs<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong> </span>The cancer has spread to bones and brain</p>
<p>Stages of SCLC</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>This type of lung cancer has its stages. The stages are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Limited stage SCLC:</strong></span> It is confined to one lung and can sometimes be in the lymph nodes in the middle of the chest or above the collarbone on the same side.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Extensive stage SCLC:</strong></span> It is widespread throughout one lung or has spread to the other lung, lymph nodes on the opposite side, or other body parts.</p>
<p>Symptoms of lung cancer</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The primary symptoms of lung cancer are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● A cough that doesn’t go away and gets worse with time<br>
● Shortness of breath<br>
● Chest pain<br>
● Wheezing<br>
● Coughing up blood<br>
● Loss of appetite<br>
● Unexplained weight loss<br>
● Fatigue<br>
● Shoulder pain<br>
● Swelling in face, neck, and arms</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complications of Lung Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lung cancer can lead to several complications. They are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● High risk of infection<br>
● Loss of lung function<br>
● Spitting up blood<br>
● Spinal compression<br>
● Heart blockage<br>
● Nerve pain<br>
● Trouble swallowing<br>
● Kidney dysfunction<br>
● Neutropenia ( when your body does not have enough neutrophils to protect you from infection)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lung cancer can affect anyone, but certain factors raise the risk of getting it:</strong></span></p>
<p>● If you smoke a lot<br>
● When you inhale the smoke released by cigarettes, you get exposed to the same cancer-causing agents<br>
● Family history of lung cancer<br>
● Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot<br>
● HIV Infection<br>
● Air pollution</p>
<p>How to detect lung cancer : Diagnosis and Tests</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Your healthcare provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:</strong></span></p>
<p>● A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms<br>
● A family history<br>
● A physical exam<br>
● Imaging tests, such as a chest X-ray or chest CT scan<br>
● Lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum<br>
● A biopsy of the lung</p>
<p>If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out how far it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lung Cancer Treatment options</strong></span></p>
<p>The primary treatment of lung cancer is surgery, where the tumor is removed, and chemotherapy and radiation are used to kill the cancer cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment options for NSCLC Include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1:</strong></span> This surgery removes the portion of the lung which is all you need. The doctor may also recommend chemotherapy if there is a risk for the cancer to return. Lung cancer is most treatable at this stage.<br>
●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Stage 2:</strong> </span>In this stage, you will need surgery to remove a part or all of your lung. You will also be recommended chemotherapy.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong></span> You will require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery ( effective in specific situations), and radiation to treat cancer.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong> </span>Options include surgery (effective in specific situations), radiation chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy.</p>
<p>The options for SCLC also include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In most cases, the cancer will be too advanced for surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>If you’re diagnosed with lung cancer, a team of tumor board will likely manage your care, including:</strong></span><br>
● a surgeon who specializes in the chest and lungs (thoracic surgeon)<br>
● a lung specialist (pulmonologist)<br>
● a medical oncologist<br>
● a radiation oncologist</p>
<p>Discuss all your treatment options before making a decision. Your doctors will coordinate care and keep each other informed. Consider discussing clinical trials with your doctor.</p>
<p>Understanding treatment options in detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Surgery is mainly recommended when NSCLC has not spread and SCLC is limited to only a single tumor. Your surgeon in India will remove the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it to make sure that no cancer cells are left behind. Sometimes, the doctors remove only a part or whole part of the lung so that the cancer doesn’t come back.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In radiation, high-energy beams are used to kill the cancer cells. It can be used to make the surgery more effective.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Chemotherapy is a combination of multiple medications that are specifically designed to stop the growth of cancer cells. It can be given before or after the surgery or with other medicines like immunotherapy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Drug Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In some people with NSCLC, lung cancer cells have specific mutations that help the cancer grow. Particular drugs target these mutations to slow down or destroy cancer cells. Other drugs, called angiogenesis inhibitors, can keep the tumor from creating new blood vessels, which the cancer cells need to grow.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Our bodies usually recognize cells that are damaged or harmful and destroy them. Cancer has ways to hide from the immune system to prevent destruction. Immunotherapy reveals cancer cells to your immune system so your body can fight lung cancer.</p>
<p>Treatments to ease symptoms (palliative care)</p>
<p>Some lung cancer treatments are used to relieve symptoms like pain and difficulty breathing. These include therapies to reduce or remove tumors blocking airways and procedures to remove fluid from around your lungs and keep it from coming back.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic Lung Cancer Treatment Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Robotic lung cancer surgery means removing part of a lung using minimally invasive techniques, including Video-Assisted Thoracic Surgery (VATS) and Robotic Assisted Thoracic Surgery (RATS).</p>
<p>Robotic lung cancer treatment in India is one of the most advanced surgeries in the world. This is a minimally invasive surgery used to treat lung cancer by removing diseased tissue using the latest Da Vinci Xi Surgical Robot.</p>
<p>The Minimal Invasive with complete automation: Surgery for lung cancer, if carried out through high-end surgical robots, provides a magnified 3D view, and wristed instruments of robots allow surgeons to make precise, controlled movements without making larger incisions in the ribs. This allows the surgeon to remove the entire tumor mass present in the thoracic cavity (chest). Other advantages include:</p>
<p>● Faster recovery<br>
● Less chance of infection post-surgery<br>
● Early discharge<br>
● The surgical outcome is unmatched<br>
● Less bleeding as compared to open surgery</p>
<p>Understanding the risks and side effects</p>
<p>The side effects depend on the treatment you are given for lung cancer.<br>
The possible side effects are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Hair loss<br>
● Nausea and vomiting<br>
● Fatigue</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>● Fatigue<br>
● Nausea, vomiting<br>
● Joint pain</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>● Shortness of breath<br>
● Cough and pain<br>
● Fatigue</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● Cough<br>
● Fatigue<br>
● Chest pain</p>
<p>Prevention of Lung Cancer</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There are some ways that you can adopt in life to reduce the risk of lung cancer:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Quit smoking if you do it.<br>
● Avoid the use of any such substances that damage your lungs<br>
● Eat a well-balanced diet<br>
● Get screened for lung cancer if you are at high risk.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Outlook/Prognosis of Lung Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>Lung cancer can be fatal, but emerging treatments in India mean that many people now survive and recover from lung cancer, especially if they receive an early diagnosis.</p>
<p>Some factors affecting the likelihood of a positive outcome include:</p>
<p>● a person’s overall health<br>
● their age<br>
● the stage of cancer at diagnosis<br>
● the type of cancer they have</p>
<p>It is not possible to predict precisely how cancer will affect an individual. Still, a healthcare professional in India can help you understand what you can expect by looking at the results of tests and other factors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lung Cancer Survival Rate</strong></span></p>
<p>The survival rate of lung cancer depends on the stage at which the cancer is diagnosed. It also depends on the overall health of the patients and other factors too.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Prostate Cancer Care Made Accessible: India’s Solutions</span></h2>
<p>Prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate. The prostate is a small walnut-shaped male gland that produces a seminal fluid responsible for nourishing and transporting sperm.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. If it grows slowly and is confined to the prostate gland, it does not cause much harm. On the other hand, if you get an aggressive form of prostate cancer, then it has a chance of spreading.</p>
<p>If you unfortunately have prostate cancer and are looking for treatment options, here we will let you know why Indian hospitals and doctors should be on the top of your list.<br>
But let us first get into details about what prostate cancer is and what are the treatment options available in India to treat it.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is Prostate Cancer?</span></h2>
<p>Cancer is a disease in which body cells grow out of control. Prostate cancer begins in the cells of the prostate. It is a gland in the male reproductive system and lies just below the urinary bladder. It makes a fluid that is part of semen.</p>
<p>It is one of the most common types of cancer. It grows very slowly and does not spread to other body parts. But sometimes, it takes an aggressive form and spreads to other body parts. This kind of cancer is pretty serious.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of Prostate Cancer</span></h2>
<p>The type of prostate cancer tells which kind of cell the cancer started in. The different types of prostate cancers are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 1:</strong> </span><strong>Adenocarcinoma of Prostate</strong></p>
<p>Adenocarcinomas develop into the gland cells that surround the prostate gland and the tubes of the prostate gland. It is the most common type of prostate cancer and has two types:</p>
<p><strong><em>Acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate</em></strong></p>
<p>Most people have this type. It develops in the gland cells that line the prostate gland.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate</strong></em></p>
<p>Ductal adenocarcinoma starts in the cells lining the prostate gland’s tubes (ducts). It tends to grow and spread more quickly than acinar adenocarcinoma.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 2:</strong></span> <strong>Transitional Cell Carcinoma of Prostate</strong></p>
<p>This type of prostate cancer starts in the cells that line the tube carrying urine to the urethra. This type of cancer usually begins in the bladder and then spreads to the prostate. That is why it is sometimes known as urothelial carcinoma of the prostate, too.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 3:</strong></span> <strong>Squamous cell carcinoma</strong></p>
<p>These cancers develop from flat cells that cover the prostate. It grows and spreads more quickly than adenocarcinoma of the prostate.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 4:</strong> </span><strong>Small Cell Prostate Cancer</strong></p>
<p>It is a rare and quite aggressive form of prostate cancer. It tends to grow quickly and is less responsive to traditional cancer treatments.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 5:</strong></span>&nbsp;<strong>Sarcomas</strong></p>
<p>It is also rare and can develop from the connective tissue within the prostate gland. It is also an aggressive form of cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type 6:</strong></span>&nbsp;<strong>Neuroendocrine tumors</strong></p>
<p>It is a rare form of cancer that can develop in the prostate and has neuroendocrine cells. It is also an aggressive form of cancer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prostate Cancer Causes</strong></span></h2>
<p>Researchers don’t know for sure what causes prostate cancer. They do know that it happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA).</p>
<p>Sometimes, these genetic changes are inherited, meaning you are born with them. Certain genetic changes happen during your lifetime that can raise your risk of prostate cancer. But often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Who is at Risk?</span></h2>
<p><em>Anyone who has a prostate gland can develop prostate cancer. But certain factors increase your chances of building it:</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Age:</strong> </span>your chances of getting prostate cancer increase with age. It is rare among people who are under 50 years old.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Family History:</strong></span> Your risk of getting prostate cancer increases if you have a family history of it.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;">The Risk of Getting Cancer also Depends on the Following:</span></h3>
<p>● Genetic factors<br>
● Race<br>
● Geography<br>
● Hormone levels</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other Possible Factors</strong></span></p>
<p><em>While more research is necessary to confirm their involvement, other factors that may influence prostate cancer risk include:</em></p>
<p>● obesity<br>
● smoking<br>
● alcohol consumption<br>
● exposure to chemicals, such as the herbicide<br>
● inflammation of the prostate<br>
● sexually transmitted infections</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The Common Prostate Cancer Symptoms are:</strong></span></h2>
<p>● Trouble urinating<br>
● Blood in urine<br>
● Blood in semen<br>
● Bone pain<br>
● Losing weight<br>
● Erectile dysfunction<br>
● Loss of bladder control<br>
● Burning sensation when you pee</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Staging in Prostate Cancer</strong></span></h2>
<p><em>Staging describes how much cancer is present in the body and how serious it is. The stages of cancer are:</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1:</strong></span> Cancer is only present in the prostate gland<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> </span>Cancer has not yet spread from the prostate, but the person has high PSA levels<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong></span> Cancer has spread to nearby tissues<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong></span> Cancer has spread to different parts of the body</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Gleason Score</strong></span></p>
<p>The Gleason score allows your provider to rate your cancer cells’ abnormality. The more abnormal cells you have, the higher your Gleason score. The Gleason score allows your provider to determine the grade of your cancer or its potential to be aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>Diagnosis</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the diagnosis of prostate cancer, a doctor in India will likely:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Ask about your symptoms<br>
● Ask about personal and medical history<br>
● Conduct a blood test<br>
● Perform imaging testing<br>
● Carry out urine tests to look for other biomarkers<br>
● Carry out a physical exam, including a digital rectal exam.</p>
<p><em><strong>Further tests</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>If the doctor expects cancer, then further tests involve</strong></span></p>
<p>● Transrectal ultrasound<br>
● Biopsy<br>
● MRI Or CT scan<br>
● PET Scan<br>
● Bone Scan</p>
<p><em>Complications of prostate cancer</em></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Various complications of prostate cancer are:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Metastatic cancer</span></strong></p>
<p>Prostate cancer can spread to your nearby organs, like your bladder, or travel through your bloodstream to your bones or other organs. Prostate cancer that spreads to bones can cause broken bones.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Urinary Incontinence</strong></span></p>
<p>Prostate cancer can cause urinary incontinence. Treatment of incontinence depends on the type of cancer you have and how severe it is.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Erectile Dysfunction</strong></span></p>
<p>Erectile dysfunction can result from prostate cancer, including surgery, radiation, or hormone treatments.</p>
<h2><strong>Prostate Cancer Treatments</strong></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immediate treatment may not be necessary.</strong></span></p>
<p>Low-grade cancers do not need treatment right away. You have to monitor it actively. Regular follow-up exams, blood tests, rectal exams, and biopsies are all you need. If doctors observe a progression in the cancer, then you can go for treatment like surgery or radiation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In radiation therapy, powered radiations are used to kill the cancer cells. Here is how radiation therapy is given to you during prostate cancer:</p>
<p>● External radiation: in this, you will lie on the table while a machine is moved around your body that will direct high energy beams to your prostate cancer.<br>
● Brachytherapy: Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive sources in your prostate tissue. Most often, the radiation is contained in rice-sized radioactive seeds that are inserted into your prostate tissue. The seeds deliver a low dose of radiation over a long period. Brachytherapy is one option for treating cancer that hasn’t spread beyond the prostate.</p>
<p>Cost of radiation in prostate cancer is about $1,400 to $5,600 for the entire course of treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Freezing or heating prostate tissue</strong></span></p>
<p>● In freezing prostate tissue, a gas is used to freeze it. The tissue is allowed to thaw, and the procedure is repeated till the cancer cells are killed. It is also known as cryotherapy.<br>
● High-intensity focused ultrasound ( HIFU) uses ultrasound energy to kill the prostate tissue in heating.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hormone therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In hormone therapy, one of the latest options for treatment of prostate cancer in India,<br>
your body stops producing testosterone, which helps cancer cells grow. Cutting off the supply of testosterone causes cancer cells to die and grow more slowly. It is often used to treat advanced prostate cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In chemotherapy, drugs are used to kill rapidly growing cancer cells. It is used when prostate cancer has spread to other parts of your body. It is also used when you do not respond to hormone therapy. Cost of chemotherapy in prostate cancer is around $700 to $2,800 per cycle of treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></span><br>
In Immunotherapy, your immune system is used to fight cancer. Your body’s disease-fighting immune system may not attack your cancer because the cancer cells produce proteins that help them hide from the immune system cells. Immunotherapy works by interfering with that process.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Drug therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Targeted therapy relies on the genetic changes that turn healthy cells into cancer cells to prevent them from growing and multiplying. Targeted therapies that treat prostate cancer destroy cancer cells with BRCA gene mutations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding Surgical options to treat prostate cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>Surgical options involve treating prostate cancer by removing a part or all of the prostate gland. Here are the main surgical options used in India to treat prostate cancer:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radical Prostatectomy</strong></span></p>
<p>In radical prostatectomy, the entire prostate gland, along with the nearby tissues, is removed. It is performed in the following ways:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Open Radical Prostatectomy</span></strong></p>
<p>It is a traditional procedure in which an incision is made to access the prostate gland. The incision is made between the scrotum and the anus.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Radical Prostatectomy</span></strong></p>
<p>India has the best robotic system for prostate cancer. It is a minimally invasive procedure in which robots perform the surgery. Several small incisions are used to access the abdomen, and this type of surgery has a fast recovery time and fewer complications as compared to the traditional ones. Cost of robotic prostate surgery in India is around 9000 USD.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Laparoscopic Radical prostatectomy</strong></span></p>
<p>It is similar to robotic surgery, but robots are not used in this type. The surgeon performs the procedure using long, thin instruments through small incisions in the abdomen.</p>
<p>Side effects of the treatment</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The potential side effects of prostate cancer treatment are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Urinary Incontinence<br>
● Erectile Dysfunction<br>
● Infertility<br>
● Bowel problems<br>
● Bone health issues<br>
● Anxiety and depression</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How to avoid prostate cancer?</strong></span></p>
<p>You can reduce the risk of prostate cancer by making the following changes in your lifestyle:</p>
<p>● Choose a diet full of fruits and vegetables<br>
● Choose healthy foods over supplements<br>
● Exercise when you can<br>
● Maintain healthy weight<br>
● Quit smoking<br>
● Get regular prostate screenings</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>Your outlook is excellent if your healthcare provider detects prostate cancer early. Almost everyone — 99% — diagnosed with cancer that hasn’t spread outside the prostate can survive at least five years.</p>
<p>Prostate cancer survival rate is not good when the cancer spreads outside the prostate gland. Thirty-two percent of people with metastatic prostate cancer are alive five years later.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Is prostate cancer curable?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, prostate cancer is curable if it is caught at an early stage.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Revolutionizing Cervical Cancer Treatment: India’s Bold Approach</span></h2>
<p>Cervical cancer is the cancer of the cervix when abnormal cells grow out of control. The cervix is the organ that joins the uterus to the vagina. This cancer affects the deep tissues of the cervix and can also spread to other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Multiple strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV, cause cervical cancer.</p>
<p>Here, we will see how you can reduce the risk of developing cervical cancer and, if you have cervical cancer, what treatment options you get in India. Let’s first delve into the details of what cervical cancer is.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cervical Cancer and its types</strong></span></p>
<p>Squamous Cell Carcinoma is the most common type, which develops where the outer cervix meets the inner cervix. 80 to 90 % of women get this cancer.</p>
<p>Adenocarcinoma: It develops in the higher part of the cervix and usually goes undetectable in pap smears. It affects 10 to 20 % of women.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What causes cervical cancer</span></strong></p>
<p>In most cases, cervical cancer is caused due to infection by HPV. Different types of HPV can cause skin &amp; genital warts and other skin disorders.</p>
<p>Most people who are sexually active get affected by HPV at some point. Most of the time, the infection will clear on its own. But if the infection does not go away, then it can lead to cervical cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></span></p>
<p>● Having sex before 18 years of age or within a year of starting your period<br>
● Multiple sexual partners, which increases exposure to HPV<br>
● Taking birth control pills, especially for longer than five years<br>
● A weakened immune system<br>
● Having a sexually transmitted disease (STD)<br>
● Haven’t been vaccinated against HPV<br>
● Multiple pregnancies<br>
● Low socio-economic strata</p>
<p>Understanding the symptoms</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Early symptoms of cervical cancer are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Pain while having sex<br>
● Unusual vaginal bleeding<br>
● Watery or bloody vaginal discharge</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms after cancer has spread:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Pelvic pain<br>
● Trouble peeing<br>
● Swollen legs<br>
● Kidney failure<br>
● Bone pain<br>
● Fatigue</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cervical Cancer Screening</strong></span></p>
<p>● PAP Smear<br>
● HPV DNA test</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">If the PAP Smear tests show signs of cancer, further tests include:</span></strong></p>
<p>● Chest X-ray<br>
● CT, MRI, and PET Scan<br>
● A colposcopy to check the vagina<br>
● A rectal exam</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cervical cancer stages</strong></span></p>
<p>Cervical cancer staging can be done as”<br>
Stage 0 is known as the pre-cancer stage, and it means that cancer is only on the surface of the cervix.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1</strong></span>: It is the early stage of the cancer and is confined to the cervix only.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> </span>In this stage, the cancer has spread beyond the cervix but is still in the pelvic area.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong> </span>Cancer has spread to the vaginal area and possibly to the kidney too.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong></span> In this stage, the cancer has spread to distant organs like the lungs, liver, bones, and other parts beyond the pelvis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment for Cancer in India</strong></span></p>
<p>Radiation Therapy</p>
<p>It uses high-energy beams to kill the cancer cells in your cervix. It is of two types:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>External Beam Radiation Therapy:</strong></span> These high-power radiations are aimed at the cancer from a machine outside the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Brachytherapy:</strong></span> It puts the radiation in or just near the cervical cancer cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Cancer cells are killed by chemotherapy (chemo), which uses drugs that are injected into veins or taken via mouth. When it enters your blood, it kills cells anywhere in your body. There are several drugs used in chemo, and they can be combined. Chemotherapy is usually given in cycles. Chemotherapy cycles and frequency depend on the drug used and where the cancer is located. The cost of chemotherapy for cervical cancer is 500 to 600 USD per cycle.</p>
<p>Surgery</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Different surgical options are used in India to treat cancer:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Laser or Ablation Surgery:</strong></span> It uses a laser beam to burn the cancer cells. It is performed in all the best hospitals for cervical cancer in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cryosurgery:</strong> </span>The surgery freezes the cancer cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Simple Hysterectomy:</strong></span> The surgery involves the removal of the uterus, sparing your vagina and surrounding lymph nodes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cone Shaped Biopsy</strong></span></p>
<p>A cone-shaped biopsy, the latest cervical cancer treatment in India, can remove all the microscopic tumors in cervical cancer. The procedure involves cutting a cone-shaped piece of cervical tissue while leaving the rest of the cervix as it is. You may be able to become pregnant with this option.</p>
<p>A radical hysterectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection: It involves removing your uterus, its surrounding tissue, also known as parametrium, your cervix, a small portion of the upper part of your vagina, and lymph nodes from your pelvis.</p>
<p>In a trachelectomy, your cervix and the upper part of your vagina are removed, but not your uterus.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cyto-Reductive Surgery for Cervical Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>In cytoreductive surgery, the tumors, affected tissues, and all surrounding lymph nodes are removed to reduce the size of the cancerous mass. By removing as many tumors as possible, the main aim of cytoreductive surgery is to increase the effectiveness of other cancer treatments.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Targeted drug therapy destroys specific cancer cells without damaging the healthy cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Immunotherapy for cervical cancer in India uses the body’s immune system to target and fight cervical cancer cells. Your immune system can fight off disease by attacking germs and other cells that should not be in your body. Immunotherapy helps the immune system to find and kill the cancer cells.</p>
<p>Possible Complications</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complications include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Risk of cervical cancer coming back or relapse<br>
● Problems with sexual, bowel, and bladder function</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Preventing cervical Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>To reduce the risk of cervical cancer, follow these tips:</p>
<p>● Receive a vaccination to prevent HPV infection.<br>
● Make sure to have a routine PAP smear test.<br>
● Practice safe sex.<br>
● Do not smoke.<br>
● Limit your sexual partners.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>It is estimated that over 90% of people who are diagnosed with cervical cancer at the earliest stage will survive five years after diagnosis. Cervical cancer is usually diagnosed early in almost half of cases. If cancer has spread to other organs or tissues, the five-year survival rate is 58%.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Does Cervical Cancer affect fertility?</strong></span></p>
<p>You can get pregnant if your cervical cancer is treated correctly. You should talk to your healthcare provider about your treatment options if you have a desire to become pregnant.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Does cervical cancer affect sex life?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, cervical cancer can affect your sex life. Specific changes like uterus removal or ovaries removal, or vaginal dryness can affect sex. It’s normal to feel nervous about having sex after cervical cancer.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Liver Cancer Treatment in India: Leading the fight against cancer</strong></span></h2>
<p>Liver cancer is a cancer that begins in the cells of your liver. Your liver is a football-sized organ that is in the upper right portion of your abdomen, beneath your right lung, and above your stomach.</p>
<p>It ranks as one of the most common types of cancer worldwide and has a high mortality rate. Early detection and timely intervention are important for improving prognosis and <strong>liver cancer treatment.</strong></p>
<p>Let us take you on a journey where we will let you know what causes liver cancer, its types, risk factors, and treatment options available in all top-tier hospitals in India.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Understanding the importance of liver</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">The liver is located on the upper right side of the body, behind the lower ribs. It performs the following functions:</span></strong></p>
<p>● Store nutrients<br>
● Remove waste products and worn-out cells from the blood<br>
● Produce bile that helps to store fats</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is liver cancer?</span></strong></p>
<p>Liver cancer is a serious medical condition that is characterized by abnormal growth of cells in the liver tissue. Liver cancer is of two types:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Primary Cancer:</span></strong> It starts in your liver</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Secondary Cancer:</span> </strong>It spreads to your liver from other parts of the body.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Primary Liver cancer is of three types:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC):</span></strong> This is the most common form of liver cancer, representing nearly all liver cancer cases.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Intrahepatic cancer (IHC):</span></strong> This is a form of cholangiocarcinoma. IHC is cancer in your liver’s bile ducts. It represents about 10% to 20% of all primary liver cancer cases.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Angiosarcoma:</span></strong> This type is very rare, representing about 1% of all primary liver cancer cases. This cancer begins in the lining of blood cells in your liver. (Angiosarcoma may also affect other organs.)</p>
<p>In India, <strong>liver cancer treatment</strong> options are available that include surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, making it one of the leading destinations for <strong>liver cancer treatment</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Symptoms of Liver cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">The major symptoms of liver cancer are:</span></strong></p>
<p>● Losing weight without trying<br>
● Loss of appetite<br>
● Upper abdominal pain<br>
● Nausea and vomiting<br>
● General weakness and fatigue<br>
● The yellow color of your skin and the whites of your eye<br>
● White and chalky stools</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Liver Cancer Stages</span></strong></p>
<p>The stage determines to what extent the cancer has spread into the body. The different stages of the cancer are:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 1:</span></strong> The cancer is confined to the liver only</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 2:</span></strong> there are small tumors in the liver that have increased in size, and one or more tumors have reached the blood vessel.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 3:</span></strong> A large number of tumors have reached the blood vessel, and cancer has also reached the gallbladder.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 4:</span> </strong>Metastasis. Liver cancer has spread to other parts of the body as well.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Causes of Liver Cancer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Primary liver cancer occurs in the livers damaged by</span></strong></p>
<p>● Alcoholic misuse<br>
● Chronic infections by hepatitis B and C<br>
● hemochromatosis( a condition with too much iron in the liver)<br>
● Cirrhosis ( scarring in the liver due to alcohol misuse)<br>
● Obesity and fatty liver disease</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Other risk factors include:</span></strong></p>
<p>● Your sex- Men are more likely to be affected than women<br>
● Your weight- obesity increases the risk of liver cancer<br>
● Anabolic steroid use<br>
● History of diabetes<br>
● Inherited metabolic disease<br>
● Rare diseases like alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, tyrosinemia, and Wilson’s disease.<br>
● Smoking</p>
<p>Diagnosis of Liver Cancer</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnostic tests for liver cancer include:</span></strong></p>
<p>● Liver function tests<br>
● Alpha Fetoprotien Test ( AFP)<br>
● Imaging Tests like ultrasounds, CT scans, and MRI scans<br>
● Liver Biopsy</p>
<p>Perfect diagnosis is essential to determine the <strong>best liver cancer treatment in India</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Best liver cancer treatment :</span></strong> Options Available in India</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">In India, your treatment plan depends on several factors:</span></strong></p>
<p>● The number, size, and location of tumors in your liver<br>
● How well your liver is functioning<br>
● Whether cirrhosis is present or not<br>
● Whether the cancer has spread to other organs</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Treatments for Liver cancer include:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">The various liver cancer treatment options in India are:</span></strong></p>
<p>Partial Hepatectomy: A partial hepatectomy is performed to remove the portion of the liver. This liver cancer surgery is performed to treat an early-stage cancer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Liver Transplant:</span></strong> In this procedure, the defective liver is replaced with a healthy liver from a suitable donor. A transplant is considered if the cancer has not spread to different organs.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Ablation:</span></strong> Ablation involves the use of heat or ethanol injections to destroy the cancer cells. It is a good option for people who are not candidates for surgery or transplant. <strong>Liver cancer surgery in India</strong> is one of the most advanced options to treat liver cancer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Radiation Therapy:</span></strong> Radiation therapy uses high-beam energy radiation to kill the cancer cells. The radiation can be delivered externally or internally.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Targeted Therapy:</span></strong> Targeted therapy uses medications designed to decrease tumor growth and blood supply. Compared to chemotherapy or radiation, these medications are fine-tuned to treat cancer cells only. This means that healthy cells can be spared from harm.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Embolization:</span></strong> This procedure is used to reduce blood supply to liver tumors. The doctor will insert small particles to create a partial blockage in the hepatic artery. Another blood vessel known as the portal vein will nourish the healthy tissues.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Chemoembolization:</span></strong> In this the doctor injects a chemotherapy drug into the hepatic artery before injecting the blocking particles. Coils made of platinum and steel are used to occlude the blood vessels. They are used as a barrier to block the blood flow.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Radioembolization:</span></strong> Radioembolization is a liver cancer treatment which is a combination of radiation therapy and embolization. It involves injecting tiny radioactive beads into the hepatic artery. This decreases blood flow to the tumor and provides radiation therapy to the direct area of the cancer.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Chemotherapy:</span></strong> Chemotherapy is a powerful drug that destroys cancer cells. It is used when other therapies are not working well.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Immunotherapy:</span></strong> Immunotherapy treats cancer using your body’s immune system. Treatment with immunotherapy drugs can help your body recognize and destroy cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Palliative Care</span></strong></p>
<p>Palliative care is specialized medical care that focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family, and your other doctors to provide an extra layer of support that complements your ongoing care. Palliative care can be used while undergoing other aggressive <strong>liver cancer treatment in India</strong>, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How can you prevent liver cancer?</strong></span></p>
<p>You can’t always prevent liver cancer. However, you can reduce the risk of liver cancer by taking the following steps as suggested by the <strong>best liver cancer treatment doctors in India:</strong></p>
<p>● Get the Hepatitis B vaccine<br>
● Take measures to prevent hepatitis C. There is no vaccine for it, but you can take the following steps to reduce the risk:<br>
● Use condoms<br>
● Avoid drug abuse<br>
● Be cautious about tattoos and piercings<br>
● Reduce the risk of cirrhosis by drinking alcohol in moderation. It would be best if you completely stop alcohol and smoking.<br>
● Take steps to treat obesity.<br>
● Follow an active and healthy lifestyle.<br>
● Eat balanced diet</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Prognosis</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">The prognosis of liver cancer surgery or any other treatment depends on several factors:</span></strong></p>
<p>● The stage at which cancer is diagnosed<br>
● The overall health of the patient<br>
● Extent of liver damage<br>
● Treatment effectiveness</p>
<p>For HCC, the five-year survival rate is 10 to 30 %. In cases where liver cancer is detected at an early stage, the prognosis becomes better, and there are chances of long-term survival. But if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the chances of survival become very low.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Ovarian Cancer Treatment in India: From Diagnosis to Victory</span></h2>
<p>Ovarian cancer is the abnormal growth of ovarian cells. These cells multiply quickly and can invade and destroy healthy tissues. Ovarian cancer is sometimes difficult to detect because symptoms do not develop until the later stages.</p>
<p>If you have ovarian cancer and you are struggling to find the best treatment options in India, you are in the right place. Here, we will discuss in detail what ovarian cancer is, what treatment options are available in India, and the best hospitals and doctors providing ovarian cancer treatment in India.</p>
<p>Besides, we will also let you know how you can avail the best facilities in India for the treatment of your ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>Let us delve into the details one by one.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are ovaries?</strong></span></p>
<p>Ovaries are reproductive glands found only in females. They produce eggs for reproduction and are also the main source of female hormones estrogen and progesterone. One ovary is on each side of the uterus.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ovarian cancer and its types</strong></span></p>
<p>Ovarian cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the ovaries. It develops when abnormal cells in the ovaries grow and multiply, thus leading to the formation of tumors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Epithelial Ovarian Cancer:</strong></span> Commonest type of ovarian cancer. They start on the outer surface of the ovaries. They can be benign, borderline malignant, or malignant.<br>
This cancer can be further classified into:</p>
<p>●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Primary Peritoneal carcinoma:</strong></span> It is a rare type of cancer that is closely related to epithelial ovarian cancer. It starts in the cells lining inside of the fallopian tube.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fallopian Tube Cancer:</strong></span> It is another cancer that is similar to epithelial cancer. It begins in the tube that carries an egg from the ovary to the uterus.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Germ Cells Ovarian Tumors:</strong> </span>These tumors start from the cells that produce eggs. Most of these tumors are benign, but some are cancerous and life-threatening as well. Its subtypes are:</p>
<p>● Teratomas<br>
● Dysgerminomas<br>
● Endodermal sinus tumors<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stromal Tumors:</strong></span> These tumors start from the structural tissue cells that hold the ovaries together and produce female hormones like estrogen and progesterone. The most common symptom of this tumor is vaginal bleeding.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ovarian Cysts:</strong> </span>A cyst is the collection of fluid inside the ovary. It is concerning for women who are not ovulating. Even though most of these cysts are benign, a few of them could turn out to be cancerous as well.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ovarian Cancer Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p>Initially, ovarian cancer does not cause any signs and symptoms. The symptoms develop in the later stages and are as follows:</p>
<p>● Abdominal bloating and swelling<br>
● Quickly feeling full after eating<br>
● Discomfort in the pelvic area<br>
● Fatigue<br>
● Back pain<br>
● Changes in bowel habits<br>
● A frequent need to urinate</p>
<p>Ovarian Cancer Causes</p>
<p>Ovarian cancer begins when cells near the ovaries develop changes in the DNA. The changes tell the cells to grow and multiply quickly, creating a mass of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to live and healthy cells to die.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></span></p>
<p>Factors that increase the risk of getting ovarian cancer are:</p>
<p>● Getting older<br>
● Being overweight or obese<br>
● Women who have their first full-term pregnancy after the age of 35 years<br>
● Women taking hormone therapy after menopause<br>
● Women who have a family history of ovarian cancer, breast cancer, or colorectal cancer<br>
● Endometriosis<br>
● Beginning menstruation at an early age or starting menopause at a later age.<br>
● Never having been pregnant.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Gene mutations:</strong></span> A small percentage of cancers are caused by gene mutations that you inherit from your parents. The genes that increase the risk of ovarian cancer include BRCA1 AND BRCA2. These genes also increase the risk of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Several other genes increase the risk of ovarian cancer, like BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ovarian Cancer Stages</strong></span></p>
<p>The stage of cancer tells you how big your cancer is and how far it has spread. The stages are as follows:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1:</strong></span> In this stage, the cancer is only in the ovaries. Surgery and chemotherapy are the main treatment options at this stage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2:</strong></span> At this stage, the cancer has grown outside the ovaries and is growing in the pelvis too. Surgery and chemotherapy are used at this stage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong> </span>At this stage, the cancer has spread outside the pelvis and to the lymph nodes as well.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong></span> At this stage, cancer has spread to other body organs some distance away from the ovaries, like the liver or lungs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p>The tests involved in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer are:</p>
<p>● Imaging tests<br>
● Ultrasound<br>
● CT Scans<br>
● MRI Scans<br>
● PET Scan<br>
● Laparoscopy<br>
● Colonoscopy<br>
● Biopsy<br>
● Blood Tests – (Ca 125)<br>
● Genetic Testing – (BRACA 1 &amp; 2)</p>
<p>Once it is confirmed that you have cancer, your doctor will use information from your tests and procedures to assign a cancer stage. The stages of ovarian cancer are from stage 1 to stage 4.</p>
<p>Treatment Options available in India to treat ovarian cancer</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Your treatment decision will depend on :</strong></span></p>
<p>● How far the cancer has spread<br>
● The type of cancer<br>
● How cells look under a microscope<br>
● Your general health and fitness levels</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The surgery in India can be done via three methods:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Traditional Method<br>
● Laparoscopic Method<br>
● Robotic Method</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>You have to discuss with your doctor which approach he will follow and why.</strong></span></p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery to remove one ovary:</strong></span> if the cancer is at an early stage and has not spread beyond one ovary, then surgery involves removing one ovary and its fallopian tube. This procedure preserves your ability to bear children in the future. It is also known as unilateral oophorectomy.</p>
<p>●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Surgery to remove both ovaries:</strong></span> if your cancer is extensive, then your surgeon can remove both your ovaries and both fallopian tubes. You can still become pregnant via frozen embryos if your uterus is left intact.</p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery to remove ovaries and uterus:</strong></span> if the stage of the cancer is high and you do not wish to have children in the future, then your surgeon here in India will remove both ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and nearby lymph nodes. This ovarian cancer treatment is called abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.</p>
<p>Surgery for advanced ovarian cancer – Cytoreductive surgery in India</p>
<p>Advanced cancer means that your cancer has spread away from the ovaries (stages 2, 3, 4)</p>
<p>● You will have surgery to remove your ovaries, fallopian tube, womb, and cervix. Your surgeon will remove as much cancer as possible if it has spread to your pelvis or abdomen. This surgery is called debulking. It is also known as cytoreductive surgery. This treatment option is available in all the best hospitals in India for ovarian cancer treatment.</p>
<p>● You will have chemotherapy after debulking surgery. The chemotherapy is done to kill the remaining cancer cells.</p>
<p>● You can also have chemotherapy before and after the surgery. This is called interval debulking surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery to the bowel</strong></span></p>
<p>Sometimes, surgeons have to remove part of the bowel if the cancer has spread there and is blocking the bowel. They may have to create an opening (stoma) on the outside of the abdomen for stool to come out into a bag. This is called a colostomy.</p>
<p>It is often only temporary. The surgeon can do a smaller operation to close the stoma up again. This happens once everything has settled down from your first operation.</p>
<p>Sometimes, part of the small intestine may be removed. In this case, an ileostomy is done.<br>
Debulking surgery can also involve the removal of the urinary bladder if the cancer has spread there.</p>
<p>Debulking surgery also involves the removal of the spleen, gallbladder, or part of the stomach, liver, or pancreas.</p>

<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Laparotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>It is an operation to look inside your pelvis and abdomen to find out if ovarian cancer has spread. It is also done to take tissue biopsies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that is used to kill the fast-growing cancer cells. These drugs can be injected via a vein and can also be taken through the mouth.</p>
<p>● Neoadjuvant chemotherapy or chemotherapy before the surgery is used when the cancer is in an advanced stage and surgery is initially not feasible due to the extent of the tumor.<br>
● Adjuvant chemotherapy or chemotherapy after the surgery is given to kill any remaining cancer cells that could not be removed during the surgery.</p>
<p>There are situations during which chemotherapy drugs may be heated and infused into the abdomen during the surgery. The drugs are left for a certain amount of time before they are drained. The operation is then completed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Radiation therapy, another ovarian cancer treatment, uses high-energy X-rays to kill the cancer cells. It is useful when the cancer has spread either near the main tumor or any distant organ like the brain or the spinal cord.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hormone therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Hormone therapy involves the use of hormones or hormone-blocking drugs to fight ovarian cancer. It is used to treat epithelial ovarian cancer or ovarian stromal tumors.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Drug Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Targeted therapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to attack parts of cancer cells that make them different from normal and healthy cells. Each type of targeted therapy works differently, but they all change the way cancer cells grow, repair, and divide.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immunotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Immunotherapy involves using medicines to stimulate a person’s immune system so that it can recognize cancer cells and destroy them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Palliative Care</strong></span></p>
<p>People with cancer need support and care, no matter what part of the journey they may be on. Communicating with your cancer care team is important as it will help you understand your treatment options and will help you make an informed decision.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the ovarian cancer treatment:</strong></span></p>
<p>After the treatment, it is important to keep several things in mind to support your overall recovery. Here is what you need to do:</p>
<p>● Attend all the follow-up appointments<br>
● Adhere to your medications<br>
● Be vigilant for any signs and symptoms of recurrence<br>
● Adopt a healthy lifestyle<br>
● Manage stress<br>
● Be aware of your sexual health<br>
● Seek support<br>
● Stay informed<br>
● Embrace self-care</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Success Rate of Treatment or Survival Rate in India</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1:</strong></span> About 95 % of women survive their cancer for five years or more after their diagnosis.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2:</strong> </span>70% survival rate<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3:</strong></span> 25 %<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4:</strong></span> 15%</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What affects survival?</strong></span></p>
<p>● When your cancer was diagnosed<br>
● The type and grade of ovarian cancer<br>
● Your general health and fitness<br>
● Age</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prevention</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There is no sure way to prevent ovarian cancer, but you can reduce the risks:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Consider taking birth control pills.<br>
● If you have a family history of breast cancer or ovarian cancer, discuss the risks with your doctor or a genetic counselor.<br>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Colon Cancer: Innovative Solutions For Treatment in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>Colon cancer is an uncontrolled growth of cells that begins in a part of the large intestine called the colon. The colon is the first and the longest part of the large intestine. Colon cancer mainly affects older adults, but it can occur at any age.</p>
<p>Colon cancer usually begins as small polyps inside the colon. Polyps are not usually cancerous, but some can turn into colon cancer over time.</p>
<p>If you are struggling with colon cancer and looking for the best<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> colon cancer treatment</strong></span> options, India is the right place for patients. Due to the presence of state-of-the-art facilities and the latest treatment options, the success rate of the treatment here is high.</p>
<p>We will also tell you how to get the best treatment for colon cancer in India.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">How does colon cancer start?</span> </strong></p>
<p>Your colon wall comprises layers of mucous membrane, tissue, and muscle. Colon cancer starts in your mucosa, the innermost lining of your colon.</p>
<p>Over time, colon polyps may become cancerous. (Cancer usually takes about 10 years to form in a colon polyp.) Left undetected and untreated, the tumor works through a layer of tissue, muscle, and the outer layer of your colon.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the different types of colon cancer? </strong></span></p>
<p>The most common type of<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> colon cancer</strong></span> starts from adenocarcinomas. It forms within the cells that make mucus in the colon or rectum.</p>
<p>Less common colon cancers are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lymphomas: </strong></span>They can form in the lymph node or the colon first.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Carcinoids: </strong></span>These start in the hormones that make cells in your intestine.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Sarcomas:</span> </strong>It forms in soft tissues such as muscles in the colon.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;">&nbsp;<strong>Symptoms and Signs of Colon Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>The <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>symptoms of colon cancer</strong></span> are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Diarrhea</li>
<li>Changes in stool consistency</li>
<li>Blood in the stool</li>
<li>Bright red bleeding from the rectum</li>
<li>Abdominal pain, cramping and bloating</li>
<li>Continuous urge to pass stools</li>
<li>Weakness and fatigue</li>
<li>Irritable bowel syndrome</li>
<li>Unexplained weight loss</li>
<li>Iron deficiency or anemia</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stages of Colon Cancer</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 0:</span> </strong>It is known as carcinoma in situ and is a very early stage. When cancer has not grown farther than the inner layer of the colon, it is easy to treat.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 1:</span> </strong>the cancer has spread to the next layer of the tissue</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 2:</span> </strong>Cancer has reached the outer layers of the colon but has not spread to the colon.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 3: </strong></span>Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the colon and has reached one of the three lymph nodes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4: </strong></span>Cancer has spread to different parts of the body.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is the reason behind colon cancer?</span> </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cancer happens due to changes in DNA in the cells, resulting in multiple gene changes and thus leading to colon cancer.</li>
<li>Polyps can also be the cause of colon cancer.</li>
<li>Adenomatous polyps (non-cancerous) have an increased risk of developing colon cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk? </strong></span></p>
<p>People who are at an increased risk of<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> colon cancer are:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Patients &gt; 50 years</li>
<li>African ethnic group</li>
<li>A patient with a history of polyps or colorectal cancer</li>
<li>Patients suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s or Ulcerative Colitis</li>
<li>If you have inherited syndromes like familial adenomatous polyposis or Lynch syndrome</li>
<li>Family history of colon cancer</li>
<li>People who take low-fiber and high-fat diet</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other major lifestyle causes</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
<li>Alcohol</li>
<li>Having a diet that includes processed meat</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How is colon cancer diagnosed? </strong></span></p>
<p>The tests to diagnose colon cancer include:</p>
<ul>
<li>CBC ( Complete Blood Count)</li>
<li>CMP ( Comprehensive Metabolic Panel)</li>
<li>CEA ( Carcinoembryonic antigen assay)</li>
<li>X rays</li>
<li>CT scan</li>
<li>MRI scan</li>
<li>PET scan</li>
<li>Ultrasound</li>
<li>Biopsy</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment Options Available in India</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgical Procedures: </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Colon Cancer surgery</strong> </span>is the most common treatment for this type of cancer. The different types of surgeries are:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Polypectomy:</span> This latest Colon Cancer Surgery</strong> involves the removal of cancerous polyps.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimally Invasive Colon Cancer Surgery or Laparoscopic Surgery: </strong></span>This type of surgery removes polyps that cannot be removed during a colonoscopy. In this procedure, the surgeon makes several small cuts called incisions in the abdominal wall. Instruments attached with cameras pass through these cuts and show the colon on a monitor.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partial Colonectomy: This involves removing</strong></span> the cancer section of the colon and some surrounding healthy tissue. The remaining healthy section of the colon is reconnected to the rectum. The procedure can be done using a minimally invasive technique known as laparoscopy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Total Colectomy: </strong></span>A total colectomy is when the entire colon is removed. It is not needed to remove colon cancer, but it is mostly done if there is a problem in other parts of the colon, like hundreds of polyps.</p>
<p>Colectomy, one of the<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> colon cancer treatments,</strong></span> is done in two ways:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Open Colectomy: </strong></span>The surgery is done using a single long incision in the belly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Laparoscopic: Laparoscopic Colon Cancer Surgery</strong> </span>uses many small incisions, and a laparoscope with a small camera is inserted through the small cuts to help the surgeon see the colon.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Robotic Surgery for Colon Cancer:</span> <span style="color: #0048ad;">Robotic surgery for Colon Cancer </span></strong>is a minimally invasive technique that uses robotic assistance for precise tumor removal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">If Colon is blocked:</span> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgical Resection with Colostomy:</strong></span> In this procedure, the surgeons remove the section of your colon that contains the tumor. If connecting a healthy colon to the rectum is not possible, the doctors create an opening ( Stoma) in the abdominal wall from the leftover intestine. This procedure is also known as<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> ostomy</strong>.</span> It allows stool to leave the body into a bag that fits in the opening.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the end of the small intestine is connected to the stoma in the skin. It is called <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>ileostomy</strong></span>. Either way, the bag sticks to the skin around the stoma to hold the stool.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the opening is for a short time to let the colon or rectum heal after the surgery. Then, it is reversed to attach the ileum to the colon after 2 to 6 months. Sometimes, ostomy cannot be reversed because the tumor can’t be removed, so the bag stays for life.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Medical Management : </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Radiofrequency Ablation:</span> </strong>This procedure uses heat to destroy the cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Adjuvant therapies are combined with the surgery like:</span> </strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy: </strong></span>Chemotherapy drugs or chemicals are used to shrink tumors and ease the symptoms of colon cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Therapy: </strong></span>This treatment uses medicines that attack certain chemicals in the cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted treatment causes cancer cells to die.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Immunotherapy is a treatment with a medicine that helps the body’s immune system </strong></span>kill cancer cells. Immunotherapy helps immune system cells find and kill cancer cells. It is used in the treatment of advanced-stage colon cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Palliative Care: </strong></span>People with cancer need support and care, no matter what journey they are on. Knowing all the options will help you make an informed decision. Palliative care is supportive care that will help you understand your diagnosis, treatment options, and ways to maintain your quality of life.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treating Cancer Stage Wise</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 0: </strong></span>Taking out the polyp or the area of cancer with a colonoscope. A partial colectomy is recommended if the tumor is too big to be removed via colonoscopy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 1: </strong></span>Partial Colectomy</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 2: </strong></span>Partial Colectomy along with removal of nearby lymph nodes. In certain cases, therapy before surgery may be recommended if the cancer is not operable. The neoadjuvant therapy can be either immunotherapy or chemotherapy, depending on the type of tumor.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Stage 3:</span> </strong>Surgery to remove the section of the colon with the cancer (partial colectomy), along with nearby lymph nodes, followed by adjuvant chemo, is the standard treatment for this stage.</p>
<p>For advanced colon cancer, which surgery, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy cannot remove, it is recommended before the surgery to shrink the tumor.</p>
<p>For the cancer that has been removed by the surgery but is found attached to a nearby organ, radiation therapy is done.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Stage 4: </strong></span>Most patients with stage 4 cancer will get chemotherapy or targeted therapy to control the cancer. Surgery is recommended in cases where cancer has spread to a few areas in other organs like the liver or lungs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How can you prevent colon cancer?</strong> </span></p>
<p>You cannot completely prevent cancer. However, you can reduce its risk by taking the following preventive measures:</p>
<ul>
<li>Decrease your intake of red and processed meat</li>
<li>Eat more plant-based food</li>
<li>Decrease dietary fats</li>
<li>Lose that extra weight</li>
<li>Quit smoking</li>
<li>Decrease your stress</li>
<li>Manage your diabetes</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>

Surgery to Remove Cancer<br>
Endoscopic Mucosal Resection is used to treat early-stage cancers when the tumor has not grown deeply into the walls of the stomach. A gastroenterologist will cut the cancer from your stomach wall and remove it via mouth.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partial Gastrectomy:</strong></span> In this procedure of stomach cancer treatment, only the part of the stomach is removed, and this is performed if the cancer is in the lower or upper part of the stomach. Part of the stomach is removed along with part of the esophagus or the first part of the small intestine.<br>
Total Gastrectomy: This stomach cancer surgery is performed when cancer is widely spread. It will remove the entire stomach, lymph nodes, spleen, parts of the esophagus, intestines, pancreas, and nearby organs if the cancer has reached them.<br>
Surgical technology used in India<br>
Open Surgical Approach: In this, a large incision will be made in the skin of the abdomen<br>
Laparoscopic: A long, thin surgical instrument with a camera at the end is inserted in the abdomen through several minor cuts.<br>
Robotic-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery: Surgeons sit at the control panel and operate the arms of the robot to perform the surgery. It is performed in top hospitals in India, such as Indraprastha Apollo and Max Healthcare.<br>
Surgical options for unresectable cancer available in India<br>

Additional Treatments<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy:</strong> </span>It is a stomach cancer treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. It is of two types:<br>
● Chemotherapy for the whole body uses medicines to kill the cancer cells.<br>
● HIPEC is the chemotherapy that goes only into the belly. It is done after the surgery, and once he removes the cancer from the stomach, chemotherapy medicines are put directly into the belly.<br>
Chemotherapy is not needed for stage 1 cancer. It is often given before the surgery to treat stage 2 and 3 cancers. It is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy given after the surgery is called adjuvant chemotherapy. It is given when some cancer cells are left behind after the surgery.<br>
Radiation Therapy: Radiation therapy uses high-energy beams to kill the cancer cell. It is often given at the same time as chemotherapy and is collectively known as chemoradiation. Doctors in India do not use radiation therapy for stage 1 cancer but use it before the surgery to treat stage 2 and stage 3 cancer to shrink the tumor before the surgery.<br>
Targeted Therapy: These treatments will use medicines to target the specific chemicals present in cancer cells. By targeting these chemicals, the cancer cells will die. It is used for advanced-stage stomach cancer.<br>
Immunotherapy is another stomach cancer treatment in which the immune system starts killing cancer cells. It is also used to treat advanced stomach cancer.<br>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">HIPEC Treatment in India: Tips and Insights</span></h2>
<p>Hyperthermic Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy, or <strong>HIPEC Treatment</strong>, is a two-step procedure for treating cancers. Cancer tumors are first surgically removed, and then heated chemo drugs are applied directly inside the abdomen to eliminate the remaining cancer cells.<br>
Today, we at Medihelp Global  will explain HIPEC Treatment in India; examine the top hospitals performing it in India, and the factors affecting its cost.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Let us look at the details one by one.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>HIPEC|| Things you need to know</strong></span></p>
<p>HIPEC treatment in Delhi involves delivering high doses of chemotherapy into the abdomen to treat cancer that has spread beyond the organ in which it originated. Abdominal cancers that have spread to the lining of the abdominal cavity( peritoneum)n can be difficult to treat through traditional chemotherapy. In such cases, doctors use HIPEC. HIPEC does not cure cancer but can surely help you live longer with cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Key Features of HIPEC</strong></span></p>
<p>● When used in combination with <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>CRS ( CYTOREDUCTIVE SURGERY)</strong></span>, the HIPEC procedure in India works best for people with cancers that spread to and are confined to the abdomen’s inner lining.<br>
● Doctors use <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>HIPEC</strong></span> to treat small cancer nodules or invisible (microscopic) cancer cells left behind after <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>CRS.</strong></span><br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>HIPEC</strong></span> provides a more potent dose of heated chemotherapy directly to the abdomen but with fewer side effects than classic chemo given in the veins.<br>
● It can effectively treat early-stage cancers with little spread.<br>
● For more aggressive or advanced cancers, your doctors may use <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>CRS-HIPEC</strong></span> with other therapies, like standard chemo given in the veins.<br>
<span style="color: #003300;"><strong>What cancers are treated by HIPEC?</strong></span><br>
Doctors in India use <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>HIPEC</strong> </span>to treat the following cancers:<br>
● Adrenal cancer<br>
● Colorectal cancer<br>
● Liver cancer<br>
● Ovarian cancer<br>
● Stomach cancer<br>
● Mesothelioma<br>
● Pancreatic cancer<br>
● Peritoneal cancer</p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>Who is a good candidate for HIPEC?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>HIPEC</strong></span> procedure in Delhi is used in patients who have metastatic cancer that has spread into the abdominal cavity. To determine if you are a good candidate for <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>HIPEC</strong></span>, your healthcare provider will consider the following:<br>
● If you have other medical conditions<br>
● What kind of cancer has spread to your body<br>
● Your overall physical health<br>
● Your surgical history.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>How does HIPEC surgery work?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>HIPEC chemotherapy in India has two steps:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cytoreductive surgery:</strong></span> To remove tumors<br>
Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>(HIPEC):</strong> </span>Floods your abdomen with a potent dose of cancer-fighting drugs to kill remaining cancer cells.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>How is it performed?</strong></span></p>
<p>● The surgery is performed under general anesthesia so that you do not feel any pain.<br>
● Your surgeon will make an incision in the belly to remove the cancerous tumors. That is cytoreductive surgery.<br>
● Next, the doctor will insert a catheter through the incision.<br>
● The catheter is connected to a machine that heats chemo drugs to 180 degrees F.<br>
● A pump will push the chemo drugs through a catheter inside your belly.<br>
● Your surgeon will move your body side to side so that the drug washes over your belly.<br>
● The time taken to complete HIPEC treatment in India depends on the amount of cancer in your belly. The minimum time is 2 hours.<br>
● After the procedure, the incisions will be closed.<br>
What will happen after the procedure?<br>
● You will stay in the ICU for two days.<br>
● You will get insulin if your blood sugar level gets too high.<br>
● Antibiotics can be given to fight any infection.<br>
● You will have to use a feeding tube to receive nutrition because the large doses of chemo can affect your bowel function. But the goal is to eat the solid food as soon as you can<br>
● Once you are out of the ICU, you have to stay in the hospital for another 04 to 06 days.</p>
<p><span style="color: #003300;"><strong>What are the advantages of HIPEC treatment in Delhi?</strong></span></p>
<p>● Improve chemotherapy absorption<br>
● Allows high doses of chemo<br>
● Enhances and concentrates chemo in the abdominal cavity only<br>
● Reduces side effects of traditional chemo<br>
● Increases survival rate</p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Pancreatic Cancer Treatment Options in India</span></strong></h2>
<p>There are several treatment options available for the treatment of pancreatic cancer in India. At Medihelp Global , we will help you choose the best treatment option, depending on your cancer stage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Your treatment will depend on the following:</strong></span></p>
<p>● The exact location of the tumor<br>
● The stage of the tumor<br>
● Your overall health<br>
● If the cancer has spread beyond the pancreas</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Staging Laparoscopy:</strong></span> Laparoscopy is a pancreatic cancer surgery option, and is first performed to determine the extent to which cancer has spread and to decide whether or not it can be resected.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Whipple Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer:</strong> </span>It is also known as pancreaticoduodenectomy. In this, the surgeon will remove the head of the pancreas as well as the body of the pancreas. Nearby structures like part of the small intestine, part of the bile duct, gallbladder, lymph nodes, and part of the stomach are also removed. The remaining bile duct and pancreas are attached to the small intestine. The end pieces of the small intestine are then reattached so that the food can pass via the gut.</p>
<p>Whipple Surgery for Pancreatic Cancer is done in top hospitals in India like Indraprastha</p>

<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ablation Treatments</strong></span></p>
<p>● Radiofrequency ablation uses high-frequency radio waves to destroy the tumor cells.<br>
● Microwave thermotherapy uses microwaves to destroy the tumor cells.<br>
● Cryosurgery destroys tumors by freezing them with a metal probe. Very cold gasses are used to freeze the cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Embolization Treatments</strong></span></p>
<p>● Arterial Embolization is done by inserting a small catheter into an artery through a small cut into the inner thigh and threading it up to the hepatic artery that feeds the tumor. With blocked blood flow, the tumor will not multiply.</p>
<p>● Chemoembolization is embolization combined with chemotherapy.</p>
<p>● Radioembolization is embolization combined with radiation therapy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Intense radiation is directed towards the cancer to kill the fast-growing cancer cells.</strong></span></p>
<p>● It can be given after the surgery ( adjuvant ) to lower the chances of cancer coming back.<br>
● To treat resectable tumors, chemotherapy is given in combination with radiation therapy.<br>
● Radiation and chemo are the main treatment options for those whose cancer cannot be treated via surgery.<br>
● It is also used to treat advanced-stage cancers.<br>
Different types of radiation therapies given in the best hospitals for pancreatic cancer in India are:<br>
● External beam radiation therapy<br>
● Intensity-modulated radiation therapy<br>
● Image-guided radiation therapy<br>
● Stereostatic Radiosurgery<br>
● Brachytherapy</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Chemotherapy</strong></span></p>
<p>● Chemo can be given before the surgery to shrink the tumor. It is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.<br>
● It can also be used after the surgery to kill the cancer cells left behind. It is called adjuvant chemotherapy.<br>
● It can also be used to relieve the symptoms of advanced-stage cancer.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Targeted Therapy:</strong></span> This pancreatic cancer treatment option in India will use medicines to target the specific chemicals present in cancer cells. By targeting these chemicals, the cancer cells will die. It is used for advanced-stage stomach cancer.<br>
Immunotherapy is another pancreatic cancer treatment in which the immune system starts killing cancer cells. It is also used to treat advanced-stage cancer.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radioactive Iodine Therapy for Thyroid Cancer</strong></span></h2>
<p>Radioactive iodine-131 thyroid cancer treatment is a safe and effective procedure for treating thyroid cancer and hyperthyroidism. It is also very brief and straightforward. Here at Medihelp Global , the best medical consulting in India, we will explain the treatment, its cost, and the best hospitals offering this treatment in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is radioactive iodine therapy?</strong></span></p>
<p>The term radioactive may sound frightening, but it is a safe treatment. It targets thyroid cells to eradicate them. It involves using radioactive isotopes -IODINE 131—to diagnose or treat thyroid-related diseases.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Iodine-131 thyroid cancer treatment in India</strong></span> is also done to destroy any thyroid tissue that is not removed by the surgery or to treat some types of thyroid cancers that have spread to lymph nodes and other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Simply put, your thyroid gland needs iodine to make thyroid hormones. You get iodine from foods and iodized salts. In this therapy, your thyroid takes the radioactive iodine and kills the thyroid cells using radiation. It is a type of nuclear medicine treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Where is RAI Therapy used?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>● Hyperthyroidism and Radioactive Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>Hyperthyroidism or Graves disease is a condition in which your entire thyroid gland is active. You will be recommended this therapy if:</p>
<p>● Antithyroid medications are not working on you<br>
● Surgery is too risky based on your overall health<br>
● Your life expectancy has decreased</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Iodine-131 thyroid cancer treatment in Delhi</strong></span> will lead to permanent destruction of your thyroid and will cure hyperthyroidism. Most people who take this treatment form must take thyroid hormone medication to maintain their thyroid levels.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>● RAI( Radioactive Iodine) therapy for Thyroid cancer</strong></span></p>
<p>If you are suffering from papillary thyroid cancer or follicular thyroid cancer, then <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radioactive iodine treatment in India</strong></span> will surely be a part of your treatment plan. It destroys the thyroid tissue that cannot be removed by surgery. It is also used to treat metastasized thyroid cancers.</p>
<p>This therapy will not work for anaplastic thyroid cancer and medullary thyroid cancer.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Medihelp Global  does not recommend this therapy if :</strong></span></p>
<p>● You are pregnant<br>
● You are breastfeeding<br>
● You have high thyroid hormone levels<br>
● You have diarrhea or vomiting</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding the Procedure</strong></span><br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pointers to keep in mind before the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● Blood tests will be done to check your thyroid levels<br>
● All thyroid-suppressing medicines will be stopped a week before the procedure. A Sr TSH &gt; 30 µIU/ml is desirable.<br>
● Follow a low-iodine diet for one to two weeks before the procedure<br>
● Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) injections to increase your radioactive thyroid absorption<br>
● If you are breastfeeding, you have to stop six weeks before the procedure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Just before the procedure:</strong></span></p>
<p>● You will have to take a pregnancy test.<br>
● You will have to undergo a body scan to check if there are any remaining cancer cells in your body.</p>
<p>Our team at Medihelp Global  will help you complete all these preparations in detail. However, follow all these instructions, be bold, and ask us questions. We work closely with patients and doctors to achieve a high success rate during <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>thyroid cancer ablation with radioiodine treatment in Delhi.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How is the procedure performed?</strong></span></p>
<p>The<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Radioactive iodine treatment in Delhi</strong></span> involves the following steps:</p>
<p>● You will be given the dose of <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>radioactive iodine ( I-131)</strong></span> orally as a capsule, liquid, or injection into a vein. The thyroid gland absorbs the radioactive iodine, emitting radiation and thus targeting and destroying the thyroid cells.<br>
● Due to iodine’s radioactive nature, strict safety measures are taken to protect you and others from radiation exposure.<br>
● After the therapy, healthcare professionals will constantly monitor you to assess the effectiveness of the treatment.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Radiation Therapy: IGRT, IMRT, CyberKnife, Zap-X &amp; Tomotherapy</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Radiation therapy</strong>, or <strong>radiotherapy</strong>, is a <strong>cancer treatment</strong> that uses high-energy X-ray beams to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy damages cells by destroying their genetic material, which controls cell growth.<br>
Here, with <strong>Medihelp Global </strong>, our readers will learn about <strong>radiation therapy</strong> in detail and the best hospitals providing it in India.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why is radiation therapy done?</strong></span></h2>
<p>The goal of<strong> radiation therapy in India</strong> is to kill as many cancer cells as possible while harming very few healthy cells. Over half of the patients with cancer receive radiation therapy at some point in their lives.<br>
Your <strong>radiation oncology</strong> team in India may suggest radiation:<br>
● As the only treatment for cancer. This is called the primary treatment.<br>
● Before surgery, to shrink a tumor. This is called neo-adjuvant therapy.<br>
● After surgery, to stop the growth of any remaining cancer cells. This is called adjuvant therapy.<br>
● In conjunction with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, to destroy cancer cells.<br>
● To relieve symptoms caused by advanced cancer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Radiation Therapy</strong></span></h2>
<p>The type of<strong> radiation therapy for cancer</strong> that you get depends on many factors:<br>
● Tumor type, size, and location<br>
● Your age, general health, and medical condition<br>
● Other cancer treatment required by you in conjunction<br>
There are two types of radiation therapy:</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>External Beam Radiation Therapy</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>EBRT</strong>, or <strong>external beam radiation therapy</strong>, uses a machine to direct high-beam rays toward the tumor. The rays can be X-rays, electrons, or protons. The different forms of EBRT are:<br>
● <strong>3D conformal radiation therapy</strong> uses CT scans and computer software to create a 3D model of the computer. The machine directs radiation beams to the target cancer site using this model.<br>
<strong>● Intensity-modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT)</strong> is a more advanced form of radiation therapy that uses many radiation beams with varying intensity. <strong>IMRT</strong> delivers high radiation doses to the tumor and low-intensity doses to healthy tissues.<br>
● <strong>Arc-Based Radiotherapy</strong>: This form of IMRT in which high-energy beams are directed in an arc-like pattern. It delivers radiation faster than IMRT.<br>
● <strong>Image-Guided Radiotherapy ( IGRT)</strong>: In this technique, the radiation machine obtains a low-dose X-ray or mini CT scan before each treatment. These images taken using <strong>IGRT in India</strong> help deliver the radiation precisely.<br>
●<strong> Particle Therapy:</strong> This type of EBRT uses protons instead of X-ray beams.<br>
● <strong>Stereostatic Radiosurgery (SRS)</strong>, also known as <strong>gamma knife surgery</strong>, uses high doses of focused radiation to destroy small brain tumors with surgical precision.<br>
● <strong>Intraoperative radiation (IORT)</strong> delivers radiation during surgery. After a tumor has been removed surgically, IORT destroys any remaining cancer cells that aren’t safe to remove surgically.<br>
● <strong>SBRT:</strong> Stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, is a cancer treatment that delivers extremely precise doses of radiation to cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissue. It uses image guidance to locate the exact location of the tumor so that the radiation can be more precise.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Internal Beam Radiation Therapy</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Internal Beam Radiation therapy</strong> uses traditions inside your body to kill the cancer cells. It treats small head, neck, breast, and cervix tumors. You can use internal radiation in a solid form or a liquid form:<br>
● <strong>Brachytherapy involves implanting</strong> a solid radioactive source, or “seed,” inside or beside a tumor. The source releases radiation to a small area to kill cancer cells. Some implants release low doses for longer periods (weeks), while others may release high doses for shorter periods (minutes). Some implants used in brachytherapy are temporary, while others stay in your body forever. Eventually, they stop releasing radiation.<br>
● <strong>Systemic therapy</strong> sends liquid radioactive material through your blood to find and destroy cancer cells. Some forms are swallowed. You’ll receive an injection through a vein (IV) for others. Treatments include radionuclide therapy (radioimmunotherapy). With radioimmunotherapy, a radioactive protein recognizes specific cancer cells, attaches to them, and then releases radiation to kill them.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Latest Developments in External Beam Radiation Therapy</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>Cyberknife</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cyberknife Therapy in India</strong> is one of the most advanced forms of radiosurgery. It is a painless, noninvasive treatment that delivers high doses of targeted radiation to destroy tumors in the body. A robotic arm provides a highly focused beam of radiation. The treatment is performed on an outpatient basis, with each treatment lasting 30 to 90 minutes. The number of sessions required will depend on the size of the tumor.<br>
<strong>Zap X</strong><br>
<strong>ZAP-X Gyroscopic Radiosurgery</strong> is a cutting-edge technology designed to precisely target and treat brain tumors. Unlike traditional methods, ZAP-X utilizes a groundbreaking, self-shielded gyroscopic linear accelerator design. This innovation enables a comprehensive attack on tumors around the head, offering a new level of precision and effectiveness with minimal radiation exposure.<br>
ZAP-X demonstrates high success, ensuring effective control and relief for various conditions with minimal long-term side effects.<br>
Continuing the legacy of innovations, <strong>Indraprastha Apollo Hospital, Delhi,</strong> is the only hospital that offers this groundbreaking technology to brain tumor patients. It is the only center in South Asia to adopt this revolutionary solution, enabling 30-minute sessions that are pain-free and non-invasive.</p>
<p><strong>Tomotherapy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tomotherapy in India</strong> is a radiation therapy that uses a donut-shaped machine to aim radiation at a tumor from multiple directions. Before radiation, a 3-D image of the cancer is taken to help doctors determine the highest dose of radiation that can be used to kill the tumor cells without harming the healthy cells.<br>
Zap X and tomotherapy are the two most frequently used <strong>radiation therapies</strong> practiced in India today due to the following:<br>
● High precision<br>
● Non-invasiveness<br>
● Efficiency</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Side effects of radiation therapy</strong></span></h2>
<p>Most people get multiple sessions of radiation therapy. The treatment schedule gives healthy tissues time to recover. The most common <strong>radiation therapy side effects</strong> include:<br>
● Fatigue<br>
● Nausea<br>
● Vomiting<br>
● Diarrhea<br>
● Skin irritation<br>
● Dry and itchy scalp<br>
● Hair loss<br>
● Mouth sores<br>
● Reduced appetite<br>
● Abdominal cramps.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the advantages?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Radiation therapy for cancer</strong> is a reliable and effective <strong>cancer treatment option</strong>. Depending on the type of cancer you have, radiation therapy can either help to treat it or can be used in conjunction with other treatment options. It is also part of <strong>palliative care</strong> and can ease cancer symptoms.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How safe is radiation treatment?</strong></span></p>
<p>Doctors have been using radiation therapy safely and effectively for years to treat cancer.<br>
● During external beam <strong>radiation therapy in Delhi</strong>, any radiation remains inside the treatment room only.<br>
● However, during internal radiation, the patient gives off radiation, so visitors should follow the given safety rules:<br>
● Do not visit the patient if you are younger than 18 years or pregnant<br>
● Stay at least 6 ft from the patient’s bed<br>
● Limit your stay to 30 minutes only.<br>
You can also follow the given safety measures after the first few days of the <strong>radiation therapy treatment</strong>:<br>
● Wash your hands after using the toilet<br>
● Use separate utensils and towels<br>
● Drink plenty of fluids<br>
● Avoid sexual activity<br>
● Try to avoid contact with infants.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Obesity and Metabolic/ Bariatric Surgery in India</span></h2>
<p>Globally, more than 1.9 billion adults are overweight and 650 million are obese. Approximately 2.8 million deaths are reported as a result of being overweight or obese.<sup>1</sup>Obesity and Type-II Diabetes (T2DM) have become pandemic. There are many ways to manage obesity; however the fastest and most dramatic option is Bariatric or weight loss surgery. It is considered to be safe and recommended for patients, who have co-morbid diabetes or hypertension and stand a higher risk due to obesity.</p>
<p>Most Indian hospitals have dedicated obesity and metabolic surgery Centers, which are at par with global standards. Delhi has become the hub for such centers, which caters <u>to more than 100 such </u>surgeries every month. These state-of-art Indian hospitals provide comprehensive treatment including obesity management, dietary and exercise consultation and a variety of patient specific surgical options such as sleeve Gastrectomy, Mini Gastric Bypass, Gastric Banding and Gastric Balloon Insertion. These surgeries are often called as Bariatric/ Metabolic or Weight loss surgery.</p>
<p>Cutting edge technology incorporating Laparoscopy and Robotics are employed to carry out precision based surgery using 4-6 small incisions (holes) in the abdomen. Also known as the Minimal Invasive Surgery, it offers significant advantages over the conventional methods of surgery. These include short hospital stay (~48 hours), faster recovery, less bleeding and risk of infections. Metabolic or weight loss surgery is very cost effective in India, especially so in Delhi, considering the availability of latest technologies and most capable doctors. Although, the costs vary depending of type of surgery and technology used, generally laparoscopic and Robotic surgery will cost around US$6000 and US$8000 respectively.</p>

			<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A hip replacement surgery</strong> is recommended when the hip joint becomes severely damaged due to a disease resulting in chronic pain, decreased quality of life and limited mobility.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A</strong> <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery</strong> is a procedure in which the surgeon removes damaged tissue/femur bone head in a patient’s hip and replaces it with an artificial joint. It is done with the help of a robotic arm hence also called robotic-assisted hip replacement surgery. The robotic procedure allows the surgery to be performed with great precision and also gives miraculous clinical results.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complex Cases: When is hip replacement surgery needed?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Here are some common conditions when hip replacement surgery is recommended to patients :</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis: </strong></span>&nbsp;It is an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks hip joints, leading to inflammation. In such circumstances, hip replacement becomes necessary to restore the function of the hips.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hip Fractures: </strong></span>A severe hip fracture can significantly impair the stability and function of hip joints. In such cases, hip replacement is required to repair the fractured bone and restore mobility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></span>&nbsp;is the most common cause of <strong>hip replacement surgery in India</strong>. It occurs when the cartilage that cushions the hip joint wears away, thus, leading to joint pain, stiffness and reduced mobility<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hip Dysplasia: </strong></span>It is a condition in which the hip joint does not develop properly. It leads to pain, instability and degeneration of the hip joint. In such cases, hip replacement becomes necessary to correct the abnormal hip structure<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Avascular Necrosis: </strong></span>This condition occurs when the blood supply to the hip joint gets disrupted which causes death of the bone tissue. This leads to deterioration of the hip joint which causes pain and limited mobility. In such cases, a hip replacement surgery can help.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Different Surgical options available for Hip Replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;Hip replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>, also known as hip arthroplasty is a procedure where the damaged hip joint is replaced with an artificial joint also known as a prosthesis. The different surgical options available for hip replacement in India are:</p>

<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Traditional Hip Replacement: </strong></span>It is the most common hip replacement surgery performed in India where a surgeon makes an incision either on the side or back of the hip and then removes damaged bone and cartilage. The damaged femur is then replaced by a metal stem<strong>. </strong>A metal o<strong>r </strong>ceramic ball is attached that serves as a hip joint. The damaged socket is also replaced with a metal socket lined with plastic or ceramic.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partial Hip Replacement: </strong></span>This type of surgery is performed when only the femoral head is fractured but the socket around it is healthy. The femoral head is replaced with a metal prosthesis whereas the socket is left intact.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Hip Resurfacing: </span>I</strong>n this procedure, the femoral head is capped with a metal head instead of removing it completely. The damaged bone and cartilage in the socket are removed and replaced with a metal cup. This surgery is mainly considered for patients who are young and active and have good bone quality.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic Hip Replacement: </strong></span>It is a minimally invasive procedure where small incisions are placed using robotic instruments leading to less tissue disruption and also promises a faster recovery. The procedure is quite similar to conventional surgery except for the very small incisions<strong>. </strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precision and Innovation in hip Joint Surgery: When should you consider robotic hip replacement?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Robotic Hip replacement surgery in Apollo</strong> hospital can be considered under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complex anatomy</strong>:</span> Patients with complicated hip anatomy, like deformities or unusual bones, may benefit from robotics. Using the robotic system, doctors can do a more precise assessment and tailor their approach to the surgery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Problems with Traditional Techniques</strong>:</span> Patients with previous hip surgeries, joint deformities, or challenging anatomical variations might benefit from robotic assistance. Robotic systems can navigate and adapt to these complexities, so they can achieve optimal results.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Younger, more active patients</strong>:</span> <strong>Robotic hip replacement surgery in India</strong> may appeal to younger patients who live an active lifestyle and want to get back to their regular routines quicker. This group of patients might benefit from robotic assistance, like reduced tissue damage and better implant positioning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precision and Accuracy: The Revolutionary Impact of Robotic Hip Replacement ( Know the complete procedure)</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the surgery: </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several steps are taken initially to ensure that the surgical procedure guarantees the desired outcome. These steps include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The process begins with an initial consultation with the surgeon who is a specialist in robotic hip replacement. The entire medical history will be evaluated to make sure that you are the perfect candidate for the procedure. It includes X-rays and MRI scans to determine the extent of damage.</li>
<li>You may also be suggested to go through some preoperative tests like blood tests, ECG and other necessary evaluations performed to determine your overall health.</li>
<li>In <strong>robotic surgery,</strong> advanced imaging techniques are used to create a 3D model of the hip joint. Combined with X-ray reports and CT reports, the results of imaging help the surgeon to create a precise treatment option for you.</li>
<li>You will then be given detailed information about the procedure like risks, benefits and recovery time after the surgery. In this step, you will get an opportunity to clear all your doubts with your surgeon.</li>
<li>You’ll get specific instructions about preoperative prep for <strong>hip replacement surgery.</strong> It might include tips on fasting before surgery, stopping or continuing medication, and changing your lifestyle. Exercises or physical therapy might also be recommended to strengthen hip muscles and get fitter.</li>
<li>A consultation with an anesthesiologist can be conducted to evaluate your suitability for anaesthesia and discuss pain management options.</li>
<li>In case there are underlying medical conditions identified during the evaluation you may be referred to another specialist for further management and optimization of your health. Depending on the case, you might need to see a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or other specialist.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The surgical team will first prepare the surgical site by cleaning and sterilizing it.</li>
<li>The surgeon will then make a small incision near the hip joint. The location of the incision differs from case to case depending on the patient factors.</li>
<li>The surgeon then used specialized instruments to cut and remove damaged bone as well as cartilage, thus preparing the area for the placement of implants.</li>
<li>The robotic system is then calibrated. It involves attaching tracking devices to the legs of the patient and then connecting them to the robotic arm.</li>
<li>The robotic arm is then utilized to position the implants precisely to the desired area.</li>
<li>Artificial implants include a metal stem, ball and socket that are then inserted into the hip joint during <strong>hip replacement surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>The robotic system allows the surgeon to make changes to the plan for the best possible placement of implants.</li>
<li>Once the implants are inserted at the right place, the incisions are closed and sterile dressings are applied to the operated area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery after the surgery: The Immediate Postoperative Care You Need</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>You need immediate post-op care after <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery in Delhi.</strong>&nbsp;The type of anaesthesia the patient gets depends on their pre-anaesthesia checkup. Usually, it takes 1.5-2 hours to do the whole thing.</li>
<li>After that, the patient is shifted to the recovery room for monitoring. The recovery from robotic-assisted surgery usually takes 3-4 days since it’s minimally invasive and causes minimal muscle and ligament damage.</li>
<li>You’ll start walking with a walker the day after surgery. It takes 4-6 weeks for you to recover</li>
<li>Initially, you can’t sit on the floor and use a commode below 18 inches high.</li>
<li>In the two months following surgery, you’ll need a high-calcium diet and supplements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Safe Return to Daily Life: Precautions to follow</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Your surgeon will give you specific instructions about weight-bearing and activity restrictions. Initially, you’ll need to use crutches or a walker and avoid putting full weight on the leg. You’ll gradually be able to increase weight bearing and participate in specific exercises and activities as your surgeon directs.</li>
<li>To prevent infection and promote healing after <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>, take good care of your incision site. Keep your incision clean and dry by changing dressings and following your surgeon’s instructions. Tell your healthcare provider if you have redness, swelling, drainage, or fever.</li>
<li>Make sure you follow the recommended measures to prevent blood clots. You’ll need compression stockings, blood thinners, and leg exercises as directed by your healthcare team, as well as taking prescribed blood thinners.</li>
<li>Take all prescribed medications as directed, including pain meds, antibiotics, and other prescriptions for your specific needs. Take your medication as prescribed to manage pain, prevent infection, and support healing.</li>
<li>Regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon after<strong> hip replacement surgery</strong> are essential to tracking your progress, assessing healing, and making any necessary adjustments to your postoperative care plan. During your recovery, make sure you attend all your appointments and communicate any concerns or issues you might have.</li>
<li>Physical therapy is important for rehabilitation. Be sure to follow your physical therapist’s instructions and participate in your exercise program. It’ll help improve balance, strengthen muscles, and restore joint mobility</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic Hip Replacement : The Life Transforming Hip Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Creating a patient-specific 3D model of the hip joint:</span> </strong></span>The robotic surgery planning system makes a 3D model of the hip joint based on the patient’s anatomy. A surgeon can visualize the surgery and plan it based on the patient’s unique anatomy.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Better Control: </strong></span>The robotic arm adds accuracy and consistency to the surgeon’s hand. By doing this, the femur can be cut, the acetabulum can be reammed, and the implant components can be placed with more accuracy. As a result of robotics, inaccuracies can be reduced by up to 94%, reducing risks of leg length shortening, dislocations, and other complications.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Safe Zone: </strong></span>All surgical cutting and reaming tools remain within the safe zone thanks to the specifications of the 3D model of the hip. As a result, you can make sure the implant components are angled and positioned as planned.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Robotic Surgery: </strong></span>With its highly precise movements, the robotic arm can operate in tight spaces and through smaller incisions. As a result, surrounding tissues get minimal damage. <strong>Robotic hip replacement surgery in India</strong> is minimally invasive and doesn’t cut any muscles around the hip.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Enhanced Outcomes: </strong></span>A study published by the American Hip Institute followed 162 patients who underwent robot-assisted hip replacement surgery for 2 years. It’s true! These patients experienced it and confirmed it.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cost of robotic hip replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In India, there are many factors which determine the<strong> cost of hip replacement surgery</strong> such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Technology Used</strong>: </span>Othopedicians in India are using three techniques to replace damaged or diseased hip joints. These techniques are open, minimal access and robotics. The latest and most accurate technique is robotic hence more expensive than conventional surgery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quality of implant</strong>:</span> There are two types of implants available in India, imported and local Indian implants are cheap but long-lasting. Imported implants such as Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Zimmer are the best in the industry hence expensive but long-lasting. These implants may last for 25 -30 years if replaced through robots due to better alignment and less trauma after surgery. Type of implant used determines <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>hip replacement surgery cost in India</strong>“</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other factors: </strong></span>The cost also depends on credentialing, privileges and experience of an orthopaedic surgeon. Hospital brand, type, size, its quality certificate whether it is following JCI protocols or NABH protocols plays a vital role in costing. Big brands such as Apollo, Max, Fortis and Medanta follow American clinical protocols, hence they are expensive. <strong>R</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>obotic hip replacement surgery cost in Delhi</strong> is high </span>since they follow good quality standards concerning second or third tier cities.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery- Transforming Knee Replacement&nbsp; </strong><strong>Surgery for Better Lives</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic knee replacement surgery</strong> </span>is often called Knee arthroplasty surgery. This can help reduce discomfort and restore function in severely damaged knee joints. This operation entails removing diseased bone and cartilage from the lower end of the thighbone, upper end of the shinbone, and kneecap and replacing it with an implant consisting of metal alloys, high-grade plastics, and polymers to make an artificial joint. This new joint is designed and aligned to mimic the function of normal human joints.</p>
<p>It becomes mandatory for patients who are in pain due to an injury in their knee joint and when no other therapy seems to be working. This may commonly be caused by age-related osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When Pain Rules: Understanding the Need for Knee Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;A knee replacement surgery</strong> is typically considered when all other treatment options fail to provide relief for chronic knee pain. Here are some common situations when a person has to go for knee replacement surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> </span>It is one of the most common reasons for knee replacement. If traditional treatment options like pain medications, and physical therapy fail to provide relief, then knee replacement is the ultimate option.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis: </strong></span>It is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation in knee joints. If the inflammation cannot be controlled via pain medications, then knee replacement is the last option considered by the doctors.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Knee Deformity:</strong> </span>Severe knee deformities like bowing in or out of the knee, can lead to uneven distribution of weight and excessive joint wear. In such cases, <strong>knee replacement surgery in India</strong> is suggested to restore normal knee function.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Failed surgeries:</strong></span> In some cases, previous knee surgeries like arthroscopy or partial knee replacement may not have provided complete relief. A total knee replacement is considered a salvage option.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other cases: </strong></span>Knee replacement is also recommended for patients suffering from avascular necrosis, knee tumors, and severe knee joint infections.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Exploring Different surgical options available for Knee Replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Total knee replacement (TKR): </strong></span>This involves replacing the whole knee joint with artificial implants. To recreate the joint, the damaged cartilage and bone are removed and replaced with metal and plastic implants. TKR relieves joint pain, improves function, and restores mobility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partial Knee Replacements (PKRs): </strong></span>Also known as unicompartmental <strong>knee replacement surgery in Apollo</strong> Hospital, India, PKRs are done when only one compartment of the knee joint is damaged. During this procedure, only the damaged section of the knee is replaced with a prosthesis, preserving the healthy parts<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Bilateral knee replacement: </strong></span>This involves replacing both knees at the same time. The procedure is good for patients with severe arthritis or damage to both knees, so they can recover and rehabilitate simultaneously.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Robotic-assisted knee replacement: </strong></span>A robotic arm system helps the surgeon with the knee replacement. It can increase precision, and accuracy, and allow a more customized implant fit, which can lead to better results.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Choosing the right knee replacement option for your needs: A detailed look at the different options available to you</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Robotic-assisted<strong> knee replacement surgery in Delhi</strong> involves the use of a robot to assist the surgeon during the knee replacement procedure. Different types of robotic knee surgeries performed in India are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fully Automatic Knee Replacement: </strong></span>In this procedure, the entire surgery is performed by the robot with minimal or no input from the surgeon. It uses preoperative imaging data and advanced algorithms to plan and execute surgeries. Robotic systems use sensors and artificial intelligence to make adjustments in real-time to align implants and ensure they’re positioned correctly. In most cases, surgeons oversee the process and can intervene, but it’s mostly autonomous.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Partially Automatic Knee Replacement: </strong></span>In a partially <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in India</strong>, there is a collaboration between the robotic system and the surgeon. The system provides real-time feedback to the surgeon and also guides the surgeon during the procedure. The surgeon takes control of the surgery and makes important decisions while the robotic system helps to enhance accuracy and precision during the procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Mako Robotic Knee Replacement-Empowering Patients with Precision and Accuracy</strong></span></h2>
<p>Over the years, knee replacement techniques and instrumentation have gone through countless improvements. In this technique, surgery is performed by a surgeon using a <strong>Mako Robotic Arm</strong>. The Mako system pre-plan your surgery and then the surgeon guides the arm to remove diseased bone or cartilage from the knee. The surgeon will then insert the implant. <strong>Mako technology</strong> was developed to provide a personalized surgical experience to patients based on their specific diagnoses and anatomy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Mako Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery in India – Know the complete procedure</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You will be advised to go through a comprehensive preoperative evaluation with the orthopedic surgeon to determine if you are a good candidate. A physical exam and diagnostic are part of this evaluation.</li>
<li>The surgeon will then discuss the benefits, risks, and expected outcomes of robotic knee replacement surgery. You can also ask any questions you have. A detailed list of preoperative instructions will be given, including medication management, fasting guidelines, and medications to stop.</li>
<li>X-rays and CT scans are used to create a 3D model of the knee joint using advanced imaging techniques. Imaging data is used in conjunction with specialized software to develop a surgical plan. The surgeon can see how bad the joint is, plan the implant positioning and alignment, and determine which prosthetic pieces are the right size and fit.</li>
<li>You may be advised to undergo preoperative medical clearance in the days leading up to&nbsp; <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in Apollo Hospital,</strong> which might include blood tests, ECGs, and other exams.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery: </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The surgery begins with a CT scan of the knee joint that is used to generate a virtual 3D model. This model is then loaded into the Mako System software and is used to create a personalized treatment plan.</li>
<li>The robotic arm and the pre-operative plan are synced and the arthritic portions of the bone appear green on the 3D model.</li>
<li>The surgeon then guides the robotic arm to remove the damaged bone. With the use of Haptic technology, the surgeon only removed the damaged area eliminating the risk of damaging the healthy bone and ligaments.</li>
<li>The Mako robot provides the exact coordinates to the surgeon for the implants. It also confirms the gaps on the inside and outside of the knee remain the same throughout the arc of motion. This results in a knee that moves efficiently with a perfect balance.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery After the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Robotic knee replacements usually heal quicker than traditional knee replacements.</li>
<li>Most people return home the same day after surgery and can walk within a few hours</li>
<li>It takes about 3-6 weeks for you to fully recover from <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>.</li>
<li>There may be a need for physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the knee.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Precautions to follow after the surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Strictly adhere to the post-operative instructions provided by the surgeon to ensure maximum recovery.</li>
<li>Take pain medications on time to avoid severe pain and discomfort.</li>
<li>Take complete rest and do gentle movements after the surgery. Avoid heavy exercises or any kind of movement that can strain the surgical area.</li>
<li>Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol because excessive drinking and smoking can interfere with the recovery process.</li>
<li>Make sure to attend all the follow-up appointments with your doctor to avoid any future complications.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Traditional vs. Robotic Surgery for Knee Replacement- Which is Better?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In the last few decades, knee replacement surgery has been the preferred treatment. This method relies heavily on X-rays for visual evaluation and manual direction.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional total knee replacement surgery</strong> involves an incision around 10 to 12 inches long. While this was the procedure used for a while and it helped patients. It’s invasive, painful, and takes a while to recover. Additionally, because conventional knee replacement surgery relies on vision and human judgment and the technique relies on bone section and soft tissue balance, it’s more likely to misalign.</p>
<p>In robotic TKA, dynamic referencing is used to assess knee stability, alignment, and range of motion while operating on the patient. This allows adjustments to be made to bone resection and prosthesis positioning during surgery. Due to the limited soft-tissue dissection and muscle injury, inflammation is reduced.</p>
<p>Compared to conventional knee replacement, <strong>robotic knee replacement</strong> has less pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and better flexion and straight leg tests after surgery on discharge.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The Profound Benefits of Robotic Knee Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Robotic Knee Replacement surgery has the following advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Enhanced Precision: </strong></span>Robotic Assisted Knee Replacement offers enhanced precision and accuracy. The computer system uses advanced algorithms to create a 3D model of the knee which helps the surgeon to perform the procedure with greater precision.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Personalized Treatment: </strong></span>The anatomy of every patient is unique and the robotic system helps to create a customized surgical plan for every individual. The pre-operative planning ensures a correct implant size and alignment. With such advantages, the outcomes are better.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Small Incisions: </strong></span>As compared to conventional knee replacement,<strong> robotic knee replacement surgery in India</strong>&nbsp;allows small incisions. It allows accurate bone preparation which helps to preserve healthy bone and soft tissue.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fewer Complications: </strong></span>Since robotic surgery is extremely precise, it has fewer complications. Accurate implant positioning and alignment decrease the chances of implant loosening leading to improved longevity and better outcomes.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fast Recovery: </strong></span>Studies have shown that patients who have robotic knee replacements feel better faster than those who have traditional knee replacements. Smaller incisions, less tissue damage, and better alignment can lead to a quicker return to normal activity and quicker rehab.</li>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Improved patient satisfaction:</strong></span> Precision, personalized treatment, and faster recovery can lead to better patient satisfaction. In the long run, patients may be able to enjoy better knee function, less pain, and a quicker return to their favourite activity.</li>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Shoulder Replacement Surgery in India: Shoulder Pain No More</span></h2>
<p>For individuals who suffer from severe shoulder pain or shoulder conditions, shoulder replacement surgery has emerged as a beacon of hope, which promises relief from pain and helps them to return to normalcy.</p>
<p>In a shoulder replacement surgery, the damaged or diseased portion of the shoulder including the upper arm is removed carefully. These areas are then replaced by artificial components that mimic the natural joint, thus restoring normal shoulder function.</p>
<p>In recent years, India has witnessed remarkable advancements in the field of orthopaedics, particularly in shoulder replacement surgery. This article will delve into all the essential points related to shoulder replacement surgery in India.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Why is shoulder replacement surgery done?</span></strong></p>
<p>Shoulder replacement surgery is done to relieve pain and treat other conditions like:<br>
● Osteoarthritis<br>
● Rotator cuff injuries<br>
● Fractures<br>
● Rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory disorders<br>
● Osteonecrosis</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Shoulder Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p>Different types of shoulder replacement surgery performed in India are:</p>
<p>● <strong>Partial Shoulder Replacement:</strong> When the socket in the shoulder joint wears off, a person is usually recommended for partial shoulder replacement. In this procedure, the surgeon will put a metal stem on the upper end of the arm bone with the ball to regain movement in the shoulder joint.<br>
● <strong>Total Shoulder Replacement:</strong> It is another technique and one of the most complex ones. It involves the replacement of a damaged shoulder joint with an artificial shoulder joint.<br>
●<strong> Reverse Shoulder Replacement:</strong> This surgery is typically suggested when the natural position of the ball and socket joint gets reversed.<br>
● <strong>Shoulder Resurfacing:</strong> In this technique, the surgeon will replace the damaged humeral joint surface with an artificial metal cap without harming any part of the humerus.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis For Shoulder Replacement Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>A series of tests are performed before the surgery to determine the best-suited technique for the shoulder joint. Some common diagnostic tests which are performed before the surgery are:<br>
● X-Ray<br>
● MRI<br>
● Electromyography</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advanced techniques and technologies for shoulder replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>In India, shoulder replacement surgery has been a success thanks to advanced techniques and technology. Here are some notable innovations:</p>
<p><strong>Minimally Invasive Surgery:</strong> Surgery with minimally invasive techniques involves smaller incisions, less tissue disruption, and faster recovery. Patients like this approach because it minimizes scarring and speeds up healing.</p>
<p><strong>Computer-assisted surgery:</strong> Computers help surgeons see the patient’s anatomy in real time during surgery. As a result, implants are placed and aligned more precisely, so risks are reduced and outcomes are improved.</p>
<p><strong>Custom implants:</strong> Some patients have unique anatomical considerations that require custom implants. With advanced imaging technologies, like 3D printing, implants can be customized for each patient.</p>
<p><strong>Biocompatible Materials:</strong> Modern implants mimic bone and cartilage’s natural properties. By doing this, the implant integrates better with the surrounding tissues and reduces complications.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding Minimally Invasive Shoulder Replacement Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<p>Minimally Invasive shoulder replacement surgery is a refined surgical technique that is used to replace the deteriorated parts of the shoulder with artificial components. Unlike traditional open surgeries, this surgery involves small incisions, special instruments, and advanced imaging to achieve the same goals with minimal disruption.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Before the Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>● A first consultation with an orthopaedic surgeon usually kicks off the process. A surgeon will review your medical history, including any underlying health conditions, medications, and previous surgeries.<br>
● An examination of the affected shoulder will be conducted to assess the range of motion, strength, and any specific shoulder issues.<br>
● To determine the best surgical approach, X-rays, MRI scans, or other imaging studies may be ordered.<br>
● Before surgery, patients are usually encouraged to try non-surgical treatments. The treatments may include physical therapy, pain meds, corticosteroid injections, and lifestyle changes.<br>
● The surgeon will explain the risks and benefits of shoulder replacement surgery to the patient.<br>
● You will be provided with detailed information about what to expect before and after the surgery.<br>
● A patient must sign informed consent, a legal document, indicating their understanding and willingness to have surgery.<br>
● As soon as the decision to have surgery is made, the surgical team starts planning. It includes figuring out what kind of anaesthesia will be used (general or regional)<br>
● Depending on the anaesthesia team’s instructions, patients might be asked to abstain from eating or drinking for a while before surgery.<br>
● Patients will have to provide a list of all their medications, supplements, and over-the-counter drugs.<br>
● To reduce infection risk, patients might need to shower with an antibacterial soap the night before or the morning of surgery.<br>
● After surgery, you’ll usually be restricted from driving, so it’s important to arrange transportation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">During the Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>The procedure of minimally invasive shoulder replacement surgery involves the following steps:</p>
<p>● The process begins with administering general or local anesthesia depending on the preference of the patients.<br>
● A small incision around 2 to 3 inches is made to reach the shoulder joint.<br>
● The surgeon then carefully navigates around muscles and tendons to access the joint.<br>
● The damaged part of the joint including the humeral head and socket are removed carefully.<br>
● Special instruments are used to place implants.<br>
● The incisions are then closed with sutures and staples.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">After the Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>During your recovery from shoulder replacement surgery, you’ll gradually improve shoulder function and reduce pain. Depending on the procedure, your overall health, and how well you follow postoperative instructions, your experience may vary. Here’s what to expect:</p>
<p>● You will have to stay in the hospital for a few days for close monitoring.<br>
● Pain and discomfort are common in the surgical area.<br>
● Initially, your shoulder will be immobilized to protect the joint and promote healing.<br>
● Physical therapy is extremely essential for recovery.<br>
● Attend all follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery.<br>
● Your surgeon will tell you to stop certain activities during the early phase of recovery.<br>
● Swelling and bruising are common in the initial days of the surgery.<br>
● Complete recovery may take several months, so be patient and give yourself time to heal.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Recovery Tips</span></strong></p>
<p>The recovery process is not so complicated but you have to follow some guidelines given by your doctor without fail. These guidelines include:<br>
● Take all medications on time<br>
● Avoid any strenuous activity post-surgery<br>
● Avoid lifting heavy objects<br>
● Avoid driving for at least a month<br>
● Do not sleep on the side of the surgical site.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Benefits of Minimally Invasive Shoulder Replacement Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>The primary benefits of the surgery include:<br>
● Small incision and less scarring<br>
● Less tissue trauma<br>
● Fast recovery<br>
● Low risk of infections and complications<br>
● Improved joint stability</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Risks Associated with the Surgery</span></strong></p>
<p>Mostly shoulder replacement surgeries are safe and effective. However, there are some complications and risks involved. These risks include:</p>
<p>● Dislocation of the ball of a new joint<br>
● Fracture in the humerus bone or scapula<br>
● Implant loosening<br>
● Rotator cuff failure<br>
● Nerve damage<br>
● Blood clots<br>
● Infection in surgical site</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What types of implants are used?</span></strong></p>
<p>There are several types of implants used in shoulder replacement surgery. The primary components used in the surgery are:</p>
<p><strong><em>Humeral Component:</em> </strong>It replaces the humerus. The material used for humeral implants includes metal alloys, ceramics, and special polymers.<br>
Glenoid Component: It replaces the worn-out socket of the shoulder joint. It is made of plastic or highly polished metal.</p>
<p><em><strong>Glenoid Liner:</strong></em> The liner helps to reduce friction within the joint. It is made of plastic.</p>
<p>Stem: It provides stability to the humeral head. It is designed based on the bone quality of the patient.</p>
<p><em><strong>Augments:</strong></em> They are additional pieces used during surgery. They provide stability to implant components.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">High-end technology-driven arthroscopic surgery in India</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is Arthroscopic surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p>Arthroscopy is a surgical procedure that lets doctors diagnose and treat the problems inside a joint. The process involves the insertion of a fibre optic camera inside the joint through a small incision. A high-definition video monitor is used to look at the joint. This allows surgeons to view the joints and repair them using special instruments.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What are the different types of Arthroscopy?</span></strong></p>
<p>Different types of arthroscopic reconstruction surgeries surgeries include:</p>
<p>● Elbow Arthroscopy<br>
● Foot and Ankle Arthroscopy<br>
● Hand and wrist arthroscopy<br>
● Hip arthroscopy<br>
● Knee Arthroscopy<br>
● Shoulder Arthroscopy</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Why is Arthroscopy performed?</span></strong><br>
Healthcare providers particularly use Arthroscopy to diagnose and treat a range of joint, ligament, and tendon problems. These problems include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #339966;"><strong>Knee</strong></span>: <strong>Knee Arthroscopy</strong> can be used to diagnose various knee problems, such as a torn meniscus or a misaligned patella (kneecap). It can be used to repair the ligaments with limited risks and an improved outlook. The process has significantly lower recovery times compared to the traditional surgical procedure.</p>
<p>Arthroscopy can also be used to diagnose and treat knee injuries, such as:<br>
o torn anterior or posterior cruciate ligaments<br>
o torn meniscus (the cartilage between the bones in the knee)<br>
o patella that’s out of position<br>
o pieces of torn cartilage that are loose in the joint<br>
o removal of a Baker’s cyst<br>
o fractures in the knee bones<br>
o swollen synovium (the lining in the joint)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hip</strong></span>: <strong>Hip arthroscopy surgery</strong> is used to repair damaged labrum, articular cartilage, or other soft tissues surrounding the joint. This damage could be due to an injury and may lead to other orthopaedic conditions such as:</p>
<p>Femoro-acetabular impingement (FAI): This results from bony over-growth along the cavity of the acetabulum (pincer impingement) or on the femoral head (cam impingement). This damages the soft tissues of the hip during movement, especially the articular cartilage.</p>
<p>O Hip Labrum Tears: The Labrum is the ring of the articular cartilage extending outside the acetabulum and helps keep the femoral head in place for the normal functioning of the joint. Many times, this ring gets damaged due to sports or other injuries.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Dysplasia</strong></span>: In this condition, the hip socket is abnormally shallow, and there is additional stress on the labrum to keep the femoral head within the socket, making the labrum more susceptible to tearing. This requires immense care while repairing, as it may lead to joint instability if not done properly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Snapping hip syndromes</strong>:</span> In this condition, the tendon rubs across the outside of the joint. In some cases, this could damage the tendon due to repeated rubbing and can be treated through surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Shoulder</strong>:</span> <strong>Shoulder Arthroscopy Surgery</strong> can be used to treat various shoulder ailments like:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rotator Cuff Tears</strong>:</span> Treatment of rotator cuff tears with shoulder arthroscopy could vary depending on the discretion of the surgeon. Some surgeons prefer Arthroscopy for all rotator cuff tears, whereas others choose Arthroscopy in certain special situations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Labral Tears</strong>:</span> Labral tears, such as Bankart tears and SLAP tears, can be easily repaired using Arthroscopy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Shoulder Bursitis</strong>:</span> In shoulder bursitis (aka Impingement syndrome), arthroscopic subacromial decompression is performed. In this procedure, the inflamed bursa and some bone are removed from the affected area around the rotator cuff tendons. This creates more space for the tendons and subside the inflammation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Biceps Tendonitis</strong>:</span> This is the inflammation of the biceps tendon and could be due to an injury or secondary to other shoulder problems.

<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before Arthroscopy procedure</strong></span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Before the surgery, you should follow the instructions of your healthcare provider. In general, you should:</strong></span></em></p>
<p>● Inform your doctor about any allergies you have<br>
● Inform about the medications and supplements you take<br>
● Let your doctor know if you are only blood thinners<br>

<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>What is an arthroscope?</strong></span></p>
<p>An arthroscope is a small tube that is inserted into the body. It contains lenses, a video camera, and light. The camera is connected to a monitor system that allows surgeons to get a view of the surgery while it is being done. It is generally coupled with other tools used for grasping, cutting, and probing.</p>
<p>● You will receive general, local, or spinal anaesthesia.<br>
● A small incision is made in the skin.<br>
● The Arthroscopy is inserted via incision.<br>
● Other incisions called portals can be made to insert other tools.<br>
● Light is transmitted at the end of the arthroscope using fibre optics.<br>
● Corrective surgery is done.<br>
● After the surgery, dressing and bandages are put on.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● After the surgery is over, you will be taken to the recovery room.<br>
● Doctors will give you some pain medication to relieve your pain.<br>
● Most arthroscopy surgeries are performed on an outpatient basis, so you will be discharged on the same day. If there are some complications, then you may have to stay at the hospital.<br>
● You will also be prescribed aspirin to prevent blood clots.<br>
● Make sure to apply ice for the first 24 hours to reduce inflammation.<br>
● Elevate your leg to reduce pain.<br>
● Take pain medicines as prescribed.<br>
● Do not consume alcohol at all.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Arthroscopy</strong></span></p>
<p>Arthroscopy surgery is a minimally invasive surgical procedure. Its benefits include:<br>
● Fast recovery<br>
● Less pain<br>
● Minimal blood loss<br>
● Less scarring</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>General Tips for Recovery</strong></span><br>
● Pay attention to pain, swelling, and any strange sensations during recovery. Get in touch with your healthcare provider if you have any concerns.<br>
● Be sure to follow your surgeon’s instructions about weight-bearing, activity level, and rehabilitation exercises.<br>
● Maintain a balanced diet to help your body heal. Make sure you stay hydrated.<br>
● Restorative sleep helps the healing process.<br>
● You should avoid alcohol and tobacco. These substances can interfere with the healing process.<br>
● It takes time to recover from an arthroscopy. To prevent setbacks or complications, be patient and don’t rush.<br>
● During your recovery, ask for emotional support from friends and family. It can be a challenging time, and having a support system can be invaluable.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Arthroscopy</strong> is a safe procedure. However, there are some risks associated with it. The complications include:<br>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Male-to-female sex change surgery in India: A Compassionate Journey from Male to Female Empowerment</span></h2>
<p>Male-to-female sex conversion operations are not new. The first male-to-female sex change surgery was performed in the early 1990s, but there are still many misconceptions related to it. To put simply, male-to-female sex conversion surgery involves a series of operations whose aim is to change the appearance and function of male genitals to match the female genitals. It includes changing the shape of the penis and testicles to create a vagina.</p>
<p>It is mostly performed on individuals who are physically male, but they identify themselves as female.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why do you feel trapped in someone else’s body?</strong></span></p>
<p>To understand this, we must understand the difference between sex and gender. Sex is the physical representation of whether a person is male or female. Gender, on the other hand, is the psychological recognition of the self. In short, sex is decided by the physical appearance of the person, and gender is the identity that one feels. It can be either male or female. When people experience discord between their sex or gender, it is known as gender dysmorphia.</p>
<p>Transsexualism is an extreme form of gender dysmorphia, and the people who experience it feel that they are trapped in the wrong body. They have a strong sense that they want to change their physical experience with the help of hormones and surgery to align it with their gender identity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is gender affirmation surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p>A gender affirmation surgery includes the procedures that are performed so that your body aligns with your gender. Unlike the sex that is assigned to people at birth, gender identity is the way you understand your body and present yourself to others.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why is the MTF surgery done?</strong></span></p>
<p>Gender affirmation surgery is a part of transitioning or “coming out” to others (and yourself) if you are transgender, nonbinary, or gender diverse. Surgeries exist that:</p>
<p>● Enhance or lessen physical characteristics associated with being male at birth (AMAB).<br>
● Enhance or lessen physical characteristics associated with being female at birth (AFAB).<br>
● Change the way your genitals look.<br>
Surgery is just one possible way to transition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>List of surgeries involved in male-to-female sex conversion</strong></span></p>
<p>No matter what your gender identity is, if you believe that you need gender reassignment surgery, then you CAN! Today, you can empower and be confident in yourself. You can fulfill your calling and be happy every day in your life.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Transwoman</strong></span></p>
<p>Male-to-female sex change surgery is to transform the male penis into a woman’s vagina from its look as well as function. Here is a list of surgeries you need to undergo to achieve this kind of sex reassignment:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Vaginal reconstruction</strong></span></p>
<p>It is a surgical procedure during which the surgeons will remove your penis and testes. They will use the tissues from the penis to construct the vagina, clitoris and the labia. Different techniques are used for vaginoplasty, but the most common is to use penile and scrotal tissue to create a vaginal canal. The surgery may also involve the removal of the penis. To put it short, it includes:</p>
<p>● Removal of the penis, known as penectomy<br>
● Removal of testicles<br>
● Creation of a vagina called vaginoplasty<br>
● Creation of the clitoris called clitoroplasty<br>
● Creation of labia called labiaplasty</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Breast Augmentation</strong></span></p>
<p>Breast augmentation is a key surgery involved in gender reassignment surgery. It involves the placement of silicone or saline implants to increase the size of the breast. The procedure is chosen by transgender women who want a more feminine body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Plastic surgery on the face</strong></span></p>
<p>It is also known as facial feminization surgery. It includes a series of techniques in which the jaws, chin, cheeks, and forehead are changed to create a more feminine appearance.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Body contouring</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>It involves a series of procedures :</strong></span></p>
<p>● Tummy Tuck: It is a surgical procedure that removes excess skin and fat from the abdomen area.<br>
● Buttock lift: It is a surgical procedure designed to lift and enhance the look of the buttock.<br>
● Liposuction: This surgical procedure uses suction to remove fat from specific body areas.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Voice Feminizing Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>This surgical procedure aims to adjust the pitch of the voice. It is a less common type of surgery, and many people follow nonsurgical techniques like voice therapy to achieve the same.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tracheal Shave</strong></span></p>
<p>This surgery is performed to reduce the prominence of Adams Apple. In this, the cartilage is shaved down to reduce its size.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Orchiectomy</strong></span></p>
<p>It involves the removal of testicles to reduce the production of testosterone. Since it removes the primary production source of testosterone in the body, it increases the effect of estrogen on the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Scalp hair transplant</strong></span></p>
<p>In this procedure of gender affirmation surgery, hair follicles are removed from the back and the side of the head and are transplanted to the balding areas.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hormone Replacement Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>In this, the individuals take estrogen and anti-androgen medications to promote the development of secondary female characteristics like the growth of breasts.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Procedure Details</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Preparing before the MTF surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● Many people choose to undergo sperm banking before undergoing the surgery. You must consult your doctor to create the best plan for your future.<br>
● You must prepare yourself mentally before the surgery. You can talk to the people who have undergone this surgery.<br>
● Please make sure to think about a proper recovery plan before the surgery. You should have someone to take care of you to cope with the aftereffects of the surgery.<br>
● In some cases, you may need to be on hormone therapy before the surgery. Depending on the type of procedure, hormones can cause changes in your body and make the surgical outcomes more effective.<br>
● Inform your doctor about the medications you are on.<br>
● Call your insurance company to find out if they cover this surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Documents to submit</strong></span></p>
<p>● Your pharmacy and medical records documenting hormone therapy<br>
● Medical records from your primary physician<br>
● Surgery-ready letters from a mental health evaluator<br>

<p>● A physical exam<br>
● Blood tests<br>
● Imaging tests</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● You will be administered anaesthesia so that you do not feel any pain during the surgery.<br>
● The surgeon will then make incisions to access the locations needed for the construction of the vagina.<br>
● The penile skin is dissected and reversed to create a neovagina.<br>
● The scrotal skin is used to create labia majora.<br>
● Scrotal tissue is used to add depth to neovagina. Surgeons will create a neovaginal canal, and the urethra is properly positioned to ensure a natural appearance of the vagina.<br>
● Clitoroplasty is performed to create a clitoris using penile tissue.<br>
● Labiaplasty is performed to create labia majora and minora using penile and scrotal tissue.<br>

<p>● 7 days in hospital<br>

<p>After gender affirmation surgery, it’s a good idea to continue seeing a mental health professional with a background in transgender care. They can support you as you adjust to life after surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits</strong></span></p>

<p>Tetralogy of Fallot is a congenital heart condition which involves four abnormalities together. The condition occurs in a newly born baby when the heart does not form correctly as the baby develops inside the womb. Fallot tetralogy is a complex and rare procedure that needs to be treated by an experienced surgeon.</p>
<p>In India, leading multi-specialty hospitals like Fortis Escorts Heart Institute conduct this treatment. It is equipped with world class facilities like neonatal intensive care units and a team of experienced doctors lead by Dr. Iyer who is one of the best surgeons in India for Tetralogy Fallot Repair.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of TOF Defects</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ventricular Septal Defect </strong>– In this effect, there is a hole in the ventricular septum. Due to this hole, the oxygenated (pure) blood gets easily mixed with deoxygenated (impure) blood.</p>
<p><strong>Pulmonary Stenosis</strong> – A person suffering from pulmonary stenosis has a narrow pulmonary valve. Consequently, the heart has to beat faster to supply blood to the lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Right Ventricular Hypertrophy</strong> – Under this condition, the right ventricle of a person thickens, due to which the heart has to pump at a faster speed to supply adequate blood to the lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Overriding Aorta</strong> – This condition is characterized by incorrect placement of the Aorta, which causes deoxygenated blood to enter the aorta instead of traveling to the pulmonary artery.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis of Fallot Tetralogy</span></strong></p>
<p>An echocardiogram, electrocardiogram, X-ray of the chest, and pulse oximetry would confirm the diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Procedure of the TOF</span></strong></p>
<p>If your child has been deducted with tetralogy, then the doctor may perform any one of the following treatments. The symptoms and the severity of the patient determine the treatment selection.</p>
<h3>Intracardiac repair</h3>
<p>This is an open-heart surgery and involves two main repairs. This procedure is performed to restore the functioning of the right ventricle. As a result, the level of oxygen inside the blood increases.</p>
<p>During the intracardiac repair, the surgeon will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patch the hole between the two lower chambers of the heart.</li>
<li>Repair or replace the narrowed pulmonary valve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Temporary shunt surgery</h3>
<p>Premature babies or babies with underdeveloped pulmonary arteries often have to undergo temporary shut surgery before intracardiac repair. In this procedure, the surgeon creates a temporary bypass between a large artery and a pulmonary artery.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Making a Difference in the Lives of Children with ASD Closure Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<p>ASD is commonly known as a hole between the two upper chambers in the heart. Generally, a new born baby is born with a small opening in the heart, which gets closed on its own with the passage of time but when it does not close properly with time. Then actually, the main problem arises, and the patient needs to undergo ASD closure Procedure.</p>
<p>India has emerged as one of the hotspots for pediatric heart surgery. It offers the best medical facilities and treatment from world-renowned doctors at very affordable pricing.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis</span> </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Echocardiogram</li>
<li>Chest X-ray.</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</li>
<li>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<p>There are several techniques through which an atrial septal defect can be closed, like</p>
<h3><strong>Open Heart Surgery </strong></h3>
<p>It is typically performed under general anesthesia then the surgeon will make an incision in the patient’s chest and separate the breastbone to access the heart.</p>
<p>The heart-lung machine will then be attached, taking over the heart and lung functions during the surgery. Once the surgeon locates the hole in the atrial septum, he may use various techniques like a patch made of synthetic material or an Amplatzer septal occluder, a small umbrella-like device inserted into the hole and expands it to cover it. The method selection depends upon the defect’s size and location.</p>
<p>Once the hole is repaired, the surgeon will test the heart to ensure it functions properly. If all is well, they will close the incision, and the patient will be moved to the intensive care unit for post-surgery recovery.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Cardiac Catheterization </strong></p>
<p>During a cardiac catheterization procedure to repair an atrial septal defect, a catheter (a thin, flexible tube) is inserted through a small incision in the patient’s groin and guided through the blood vessels to the heart.</p>
<p>Once the catheter reaches the defect, a small device called a septal occluder is deployed through the catheter and positioned across the defect. The occluder is made of two discs connected by a hinge and is designed to cover the hole and seal it off.</p>
<p>The occluder is released and expanded, pressing against the heart’s walls and sealing the hole. The catheter is removed, and the incision is closed with stitches or staples. Sometimes, a patch may be used instead of an occluder to repair the hole.</p>
<p>The procedure typically takes about an hour and is performed under general anesthesia.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Robotic Assistant Surgery</strong></p>
<p>It is the latest and more advanced technological procedure performed with the help of robotic arms with a small incision.</p>
<p>The robot is equipped with instruments and a camera that allow the surgeon to operate remotely using a console in the operating room.</p>
<p>The patient is placed under general anesthesia, and the robot is placed near the patient’s chest. The surgeon then uses the robot to make small incisions in the chest and access the hole in the atrial septal defect.</p>
<p>Once the hole is located, the surgeon uses the robot to sew it closed using suture material. The incisions are then closed, and the patient is taken to recovery.</p>
<p>The benefits of using robotic surgery include a shorter recovery time and less scarring, as the incisions are smaller and more precise.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Merits of each surgery&nbsp;</strong></span></h2>
<h3><strong>1. </strong><strong>Open heart surgery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Provides direct access to the heart for surgical correction.</li>
<li>Can allow for more complex repairs to be performed</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>2. </strong><strong>Cardiac catheterization</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Less invasive than open heart surgery</li>
<li>Short recovery time</li>
<li>Can be performed using local anesthesia</li>
<li>Used to diagnose and treat atrial septal defect</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>3. </strong><strong>Robotic assistant surgery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Less invasive than traditional open heart surgery, with smaller incisions and shorter recovery time</li>
<li>Increased precision and accuracy in surgical procedures due to the use of robotic technology</li>
<li>Reduced risk of infection and complications due to minimize contact with the patient’s body</li>
<li>Decreased patient pain and discomfort due to the use of smaller incisions and less trauma to the body</li>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>“Parents’ love saves children’s lives: The miracle of Arterial Switch surgery.”</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Arterial Switch Surgery</strong> is a surgical procedure performed on children to cure transposition of the great arteries (TGA). It is a congenital heart defect in which the aorta and pulmonary artery are interchanged inside the human body. The aorta originates from the right ventricle, while the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. During surgery, the surgeon switches the aorta and pulmonary artery positions and connects them to the heart’s right chambers. This allows the oxygen-rich blood to be pumped into the body and the oxygen-poor blood to be pumped to the lungs.</p>
<p>With a team of highly skilled and experienced surgeons, India has state-of-the-art medical facilities to provide the best and most economical Arterial Switch procedure in the world. India’s medical tourism industry is well-established and offers a wide range of support and assistance for international patients.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis of Transposition of the Great Arteries</span> </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Echocardiogram</li>
<li>Chest X-ray</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Arterial Switch Procedure</strong></span></h2>
<p>The procedure starts with a median sternotomy, which is an incision made through the breastbone to access the heart. The surgeon then separates the heart from the surrounding tissue and makes an incision in the atria, the heart’s upper chamber.</p>
<p>The surgeon then detaches the aorta and the pulmonary artery from their original positions and reattaches them to their correct positions. The aorta is attached to the left ventricle, while the pulmonary artery is attached to the right ventricle.</p>
<p>The surgeon then closes the incision in the atria and reconnects the coronary artery to the new aorta. Finally, the incision in the breastbone is closed, and the patient is moved to the intensive care unit for post-operative care.</p>
<p>The recovery time for the Arterial Switch procedure varies depending on the patient’s condition but typically takes around 4-6 weeks.</p>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Merits of the Arterial Switch Procedure</span> </strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It is performed on a beating heart, which reduces the risk of complications.</li>
<li>It preserves the native coronary artery connections, reducing coronary artery obstruction risk. This is important as other surgical options can obstruct original coronary artery connections.</li>
<li>Can be performed on newborns and infants and has improved patients’ survival and quality of life.</li>
<li>With a high success rate and is considered as the gold standard treatment for the Transposition of the Great Arteries.</li>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Your Support Can Help Your Child Overcome BD Glenn on Bypass Surgery</span> </strong></h2>
<p>Congenital heart defects (CHD) are a group of disorders present at birth and involve the heart’s structure. These defects can vary in severity and may affect how the heart functions. Common types may include atrial septal defects, ventricular septal defects, and transposition of the great arteries.</p>
<p>Some individuals may not experience any symptoms, while others may have severe ones requiring medical intervention. Its treatment may include medications, surgery, or other procedures.</p>
<p>India has a well-developed healthcare system with many skilled and experienced medical professionals. The quality of care provided in India is generally high and can be comparable to other developed countries.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The Procedure of Bidirectional Glenn on ByPass</strong></span></h2>
<p>The bidirectional Glenn procedure, also known as a <strong>Hemi-Fontan or partial Fontan procedure</strong>, is a surgical intervention used to treat complex congenital heart defects involving the heart’s upper chamber. The process is generally performed in children or young adults.</p>
<p>During the procedure, the surgeon will create a connection between the superior vena cava and the pulmonary artery to bypass the right atrium; this reduces the workload on the right ventricle. This connection is known as a bidirectional Glenn shunt. It allows oxygen-depleted blood to bypass the right atrium and return directly to the lungs, where it can be oxygenated.</p>
<p>The procedure is typically performed using a combination of open-heart surgery and minimally invasive techniques, such as endoscopic or robotic surgery. The surgeon will make an incision in the chest to access the heart and then carefully create the connection. Once done, the surgeon will close the incision and allow the patient to recover in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>A Fontan procedure typically follows the bidirectional Glenn procedure. The time gap between the bidirectional Glenn procedure and the Fontan procedure can vary greatly depending on the patient’s specific circumstances.</p>
<p>The bidirectional Glenn procedure is generally performed at around 4-6 months, while the Fontan procedure is typically performed at approximately 18-24 months. The time gap between the bidirectional Glenn procedure and the Fontan procedure can vary greatly depending on the patient’s specific circumstances.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Bringing Hope to Families: Bentall Surgery Now Available for Children.”</span></h2>
<p>A Bentall procedure, also known as a Bentall-DeBono procedure, is used to treat Aortic Valve Stenosis, Aortic aneurysms, Aortic root dilatation, and Aortic dissection. These medical conditions affect the proper functioning of the aorta, which is the main artery in the human body. It carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body.</p>
<p>It must function correctly to maintain proper blood flow and to deliver essential nutrients and oxygen to the organs and tissues. Damage or blockage of the aorta can lead to serious health complications such as heart attack, stroke, and organ failure.</p>
<p>Bentall surgery is a complex procedure and must be performed by a skilled surgeon with experience in this type of surgery. India has many hospitals and clinics that provide excellent post-operative care for patients, which helps them recover faster from the Bentall procedure. Also, India has a large pool of highly skilled and experienced cardiovascular surgeons who are well-trained in performing the Bentall procedure.</p>

<li>Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scans</li>
<li>Angiography</li>
<li>Aortic Doppler ultrasound</li>
<li>Echocardiography</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Bentall Surgery Procedure</span></h2>
<p>The patient will be given general anesthesia during the process. The surgeon removes the damaged aortic valve and replaces it with a mechanical or biological valve by making an incision in the chest.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Aortic aneurysm treatment</span></h2>
<p>Bentall surgery, also known as a composite aortic root replacement, is a complex procedure used to repair an aortic aneurysm in children. This type of aneurysm occurs in the aortic root, which is the area where the aorta (the main blood vessel that carries oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body) meets the heart. During Bentall surgery, the damaged portion of the aortic root is removed and replaced with a synthetic graft. T</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Mechanical vs Biological Valves</span></h2>
<p>Each type of valve has its advantages and disadvantages; the choice between them will depend on the individual patient’s needs and medical history.</p>
<h3>Mechanical valves:</h3>
<ul>
<li>These valves are made from metal or pyrolytic carbon, and are designed to last longer without needing replacement.</li>
<li>They can withstand high pressure and flow rates, making them suitable for patients with severe valve damage or atrial fibrillation.</li>
<li>However, they require long-term blood thinning medication, such as warfarin, to prevent blood clots from forming on the valve.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Biological valves:</h3>
<ul>
<li>These valves are made from animal tissue, such as pig or cow heart valves, and are designed to be less likely to cause blood clots or infection.</li>
<li>They can be used in patients who cannot take long-term blood thinning medication.</li>
<li>However, they typically have a shorter lifespan and may require replacement within 10-15 years.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">“Bringing Hope to Parents: BT Shunt with Bypass Surgery Brings Life-Changing Results”</span></h2>
<p>The Blalock-Taussig shunt with bypass is a surgical procedure used to treat congenital heart defects like Atrial septal defect, Ventricular septal defect, Tetralogy of Fallot, Pulmonary stenosis, and Coarctation of the aorta that occurs in children since birth. Congenital heart defects can disrupt the normal flow of blood through the heart and the body, leading to low oxygen levels in the tissues and organs.</p>
<p>India has a large pool of highly skilled and experienced doctors who are trained in the latest medical techniques. These doctors are well-equipped to handle complex medical procedures like the Blalock Taussig Shunt with Bypass.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis of Blalock Taussing Shunt with Bypass</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Electrocardiogram</li>
<li>ECG</li>
<li>Chest X-Ray</li>
<li>Blood tests</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">The procedure of Blalock-Taussig Shunt with Bypass</span></h2>
<p>During the Blalock-Taussig Shunt with Bypass procedure, a surgeon creates a shunt or small channel between the aorta and the pulmonary artery to increase blood flow to the lungs. This procedure is often performed on individuals with congenital heart defects that cause a lack of sufficient blood flow to the lungs.</p>
<p>During the procedure, a small incision is made in the chest, and a tube, called a shunt, is inserted between the aorta and the pulmonary artery. This shunt allows blood to flow from the aorta to the pulmonary artery, bypassing any abnormalities or blockages in the heart. Additionally, a bypass is created by connecting a vein or artery from another part of the body to the shunt, allowing for an alternate flow of blood to the lungs. The procedure is typically performed on children and is done under general anesthesia.</p>
<p>Once the shunt is in place, the surgeon closes the incision, taking the patient to the recovery room to be monitored. The procedure typically takes about two hours to complete and carries a low risk of complications.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Cost of Surgery</span></h2>
<p>The average BT Shunt Surgery price in India is 4,800 USD</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">The Fontan Procedure Giving Hope to Parents and Children”</span></h2>
<p>The Fontan procedure, also known as Fontan Kreutzer, is a surgical procedure named after Dr. Pierre Fontan, who developed the procedure in the 1970s.&nbsp; It is primarily used in treating single ventricles heart defects like hypoplastic left heart syndrome, tricuspid atresia, and pulmonary atresia, where the heart has only one functioning pumping chamber instead of two.</p>
<p>It involves rerouting the blood flow in the heart so that it bypasses the defective ventricle and allows oxygenated blood to flow to the body. The procedure is typically performed on children or young adults. The Fontan procedure aims to improve the patient’s quality of life and allow them to lead a more normal, active lifestyle.</p>
<p>The cost of the Fontan procedure in India is significantly lower compared to other countries, making it more affordable for patients. Not just this, India also has some of the best cardiac surgeons in the world who are highly skilled and experienced in performing the Fontan procedure.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis of Fontan</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Physical Examination</li>
<li>Echocardiogram</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram</li>
<li>Chest x-ray</li>
<li>Cardiac catheterization</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Procedure of Fontan</span></h2>
<p>Before the surgery begins, you will be given general anesthesia to put you to sleep during the procedure. This typically takes 4-6 hours to complete. During the first stage of the procedure, the oxygen-poor blood is redirected to the lungs by disconnecting the blood supplies from the pulmonary arteries. Then a shunt is created by disconnecting the superior vena cava from the heart and redirecting it into the pulmonary arteries. While the inferior vena cava remains intact. During the second phase, the oxygen-poor blood from the inferior vena cava to the lungs. After the surgery, you will be taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring. You may have a breathing tube for a few days to help you breathe. You will also have a tube in your bladder to drain urine.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Cost of Surgery</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>On average, Fontan Procedure cost in India ranges somewhere between USD 7000 to 8000 USD approx.</li>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Closure of PDA Brings World – Class Results in Indian Hospitals</span></h2>
<p>Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a congenital heart defect that occurs when the ductus arteriosus, a blood vessel that connects the aorta and the pulmonary artery, fails to close after birth. This results in a persistent connection between the two arteries, allowing blood to flow and bypass the lungs.</p>
<p>PDA can cause weakening heart muscles and other complications because it allows oxygenated blood from the aorta to mix with deoxygenated blood from the pulmonary artery, leading to an increased workload on the heart and reduced oxygen levels in the body.</p>
<p>Today India has emerged as a world leader in cardiac treatments. It has some of the best hospitals and doctors but also one of the highest success rates of heart surgery.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Diagnosis</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>X-Ray</li>
<li>Echocardiography</li>
<li>ECG</li>
<li>Physical examination (heart murmur)</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">About the Surgery</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) closure surgery is performed by a surgeon on an infant only after six months of his birth. The patient will be provided necessary anesthesia to remain calm throughout the procedure. To reach a Patent ductus arteriosus, the surgeon will make a small cut into the rib of the patient once the Patent ductus arteriosus is closed, the surgeon will stitch the opening. The complication of the procedure is only for a small duration and is less complex.</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of DPA Surgery</span></h2>
<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgical Closure</h3>
<p>This procedure is only adopted once the medication does not prove effective in curing your child’s condition. It may take a few weeks to recover from this surgery. This procedure is also used on adults to relieve them from Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).</p>
<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Catheter procedures</h3>
<p>In this procedure, a catheter is inserted through a small incision in the leg and guided to the PDA using X-ray imaging. A device, such as a coil or a patch, is placed through the catheter and into the PDA. The device blocks blood flow through the PDA, allowing it to close on its own. Transcatheter closure is a less invasive alternative to open-heart surgery and may be used in patients who are not candidates for surgery.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>PDA Closure Surgery Cost in India: Factors Affecting</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">PDA or Patent Ductus Arteriosus is a very common congenital disease seen in babies. Here are the things that will determine the PDA cost procedure in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of Hospital You Choose: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The type of hospital you choose for your child’s surgery will significantly determine the overall cost of the surgery. The cost will be higher if the hospital is JCI accredited, a super-speciality hospital, or a single super-speciality hospital. The price can also be high if the hospital has a single dedicated cardiology unit for infants.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Cardiologist Fee: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">A substantial expense with your PDA Device Closure Treatment will be your cardiologist fee. We recommend getting the procedure done by only experienced, skilled, board-certified surgeons capable of delivering successful heart surgeries. Charges may vary from surgeon to surgeon, but the cost will always be higher if you get the procedure done by a skilled doctor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of Surgical Approach:&nbsp; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">with the hope of improving patient care, new techniques and technology are continuously being improved in India. The charges vary depending on your surgical approach ( open heart surgery or transcatheter closure).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Surgical Facility: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost also depends on the surgical facility. The cost will be more if:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital is private and reputed. The cost will be higher if the hospital is branded.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The hospital has special cardiac centres with state-of-the-art facilities&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presence of highly skilled cardiologists and interventional cardiologists.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Geographical location of the hospital. The cost is higher in hospitals located in metro cities.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Duration of Hospital Stay: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost highly depends on the duration of the hospital stay. The price will increase if your stay in the hospital is more extended. Plus, the costs will increase if you choose a private room to stay.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Other costs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other costs include:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diagnostic Imaging</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Laboratory Test</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specialized Nursing</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anesthesia fees</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preoperative care and tests</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Post-operative care and tests</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Economic Factors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The overall cost of healthcare in India may be influenced by economic factors such as inflation rates, currency fluctuations, and government policies affecting healthcare financing and pricing.</span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Saving Your Children’s Hearts – The Importance of Treating VSD”</span></h2>
<p>Ventricular septal defect (VSD) closure is a surgical procedure used to repair a hole in the wall separating the two lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This hole, known as a VSD, allows blood to flow between the two ventricles, leading to abnormal oxygen levels in the body and an increased risk of heart failure. VSD surgery cost in India depends on several factors still India offers pocket – friendly pediatric heart surgery world wide.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why India may be a good option for ventricular septal defect closure Cost, Expertise, Infrastructure, and Patient-friendly policies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis of Ventricular Septal Defect</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Echocardiogram</li>
<li>Chest X-ray</li>
<li>Electrocardiogram</li>
<li>Cardiac Magnetic resonance imaging</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of procedure for treating Ventricular Septal Defect</span></strong></p>
<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Surgical Repair</h3>
<p>During the process, the surgeon opens the chest by making an incision. He then uses a patch or other material to close the hole. The surgery successfully corrected the defect and improved the patient’s heart function.</p>
<h4>Merits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Improves fatigue, and rapid &amp; shortening of breathing.</li>
<li>Decreases risk of heart failure and arrhythmias.</li>
<li>It improves oxygen levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Catheter-based closure</h3>
<p>A small catheter is inserted through a vein in the leg and guided to the heart to place a device that closes the defect. This procedure is usually done on older children or adults.</p>
<h4>Merits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Performed with minimal sedation</li>
<li>Minimal scarring</li>
<li>Fewer complications compared to open-heart surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transcatheter closure</h3>
<p>Like catheter-based closure, a device is inserted through a vein in the neck rather than the leg. This procedure is usually done on more minor defects or patients who are not good candidates for surgery.</p>
<h4>Merits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Less invasive than open heart surgery</li>
<li>Reduced risk of infection</li>
<li>Quicker return to normal activities</li>
</ul>
<h3>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Robotic Procedure</h3>
<p>The robotic procedure involves making small incisions in the chest and using a robotic arm to insert and manipulate surgical instruments. It is a minimally invasive surgery where the hole is closed by sutures or a patch. The surgeon controls the robot from a console, allowing for precise movements. The robotic procedure has a shorter recovery time and fewer complications.</p>
<h4>Merits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Minimally Invasive procedure</li>
<li>More Precise</li>
<li>Painless , infection less ,blood less procedure</li>
<li>Faster recovery due to small cut size</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, the defect is minor and does not cause significant symptoms, so it is not treated with any of the above procedures. Instead, the patient is monitored with regular check-ups and treated with medications.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Contoura Super Vision Surgery in India</span></h2>
<p>Contoura surgery, also known as topography-guided LASIK or T-CAT (Topography-guided Custom Ablation Treatment), is an advanced form of laser eye surgery that uses a specialized mapping system to create a personalized treatment plan for each patient. This procedure can correct a wide range of vision problems, including nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism, and can provide patients with a higher quality of vision than traditional LASIK surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Indications:</strong></span></p>
<p>Contoura surgery is indicated for patients with refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia, and astigmatism. It is also used to correct irregularities in the corneal surface, such as those caused by previous eye surgeries, keratoconus, or corneal scarring.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Treatment options available for vision correction surgery in India</span></h2>
<p>There is only one type of Contoura surgery that involves the use of topography-guided LASIK technology. However, the technique used to create the corneal flap can vary, including:</p>
<p><strong>Bladeless LASIK: </strong>This technique uses a laser to create the corneal flap, which is lifted to allow the laser to reshape the cornea.</p>
<p><strong>Microkeratome LASIK:</strong> This technique uses a mechanical blade to create the corneal flap, which is lifted to allow the laser to reshape the cornea.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">How Contoura Surgery is Performed?</span></h2>
<p><strong>Before surgery</strong>, the patient undergoes a thorough evaluation, including a physical examination, eye tests, and corneal topography mapping. The surgeon will discuss the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives with the patient and obtain informed consent.</p>
<p><strong>During the surgery,</strong> the patient is placed under local anesthesia, and an instrument called a microkeratome or a laser is used to create a thin flap in the cornea. The surgeon then uses the Contoura system to map the cornea and create a personalized treatment plan. The procedure involves reshaping the cornea and adjusting the cornea position.</p>
<p><strong>After surgery</strong>, the patient may experience some discomfort, dryness, and blurry vision. Eye drops, pain medication, and antibiotics may be prescribed to manage these symptoms. The patient is advised to restrain from strenuous and heavy lifting activities. Your doctor will advise you in detail.</p>
<p>Follow-up and recovery involve regular check-ups with the surgeon to monitor the healing process and ensure the absence of complications. The patient should also follow a healthy diet, avoid smoking and alcohol consumption, and wear eye protection when engaging in sports or other physical activities.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Advantages of Contoura over conventional methods:</span></h2>
<p>Personalized Treatment: The advanced mapping system used in Contoura surgery creates a personalized treatment plan that is tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient’s cornea.</p>
<p><strong>Improved Vision Quality:</strong> Contoura surgery can provide patients with a higher quality of vision than traditional LASIK surgery, with better contrast sensitivity, sharper vision, and reduced glare and halos.</p>
<p><strong>Reduced Risk of Complications:</strong> Contoura surgery has a lower risk of complications such as night vision problems, glare, and halos than traditional LASIK surgery.</p>
<p>The timeline for Contoura surgery for patients can vary depending on several factors, including the patient’s overall health, the severity of their vision problems, and their individual healing time. However, the following timeline can be used as a general guide:</p>
<p><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> The patient meets with the surgeon to undergo a comprehensive eye examination and discuss the procedure, risks, benefits, and alternatives. This typically takes 1-2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Preoperative Testing:</strong> The patient undergoes a series of tests, including corneal topography mapping, wavefront analysis, and measurements of the cornea and pupils. This typically takes 1-2 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Surgery Day:</strong> The surgery itself usually takes less than 30 minutes, but the patient should plan to spend several hours at the surgical center for preparation and recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Postoperative Care:</strong> The patient will need to follow a strict regimen of eye drops and other medications for several weeks after surgery. They should also avoid strenuous activity, swimming, and other activities that may cause eye strain or trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Follow-up Visits:</strong> The patient will need to return to the surgeon for several postoperative appointments to monitor their healing and ensure there are no complications. The first follow-up visit is typically scheduled the day after surgery, and subsequent visits are usually scheduled at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery.</p>
<p>Overall, most patients should expect to take at least a week to recover fully from Contoura surgery. It is also essential to follow the surgeon’s instructions carefully to avoid complications and ensure the best possible outcome.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Clinical Outcomes:</span></h2>
<p>Clinical studies have shown that Contoura surgery can provide patients with better visual outcomes and fewer side effects compared to traditional LASIK surgery. One study published in the Journal of Refractive Surgery found that patients who underwent Contoura surgery had significantly better visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, and refractive outcomes compared to those who underwent conventional LASIK. Another study published in the Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery found that Contoura surgery resulted in a higher percentage of patients achieving 20/20 or better vision compared to conventional LASIK.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Factors That Affect Contoura Super Vision Surgery Cost in India&nbsp;</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Contoura Vision is the latest advancement in Specs removal by Laser Vision Correction. It is an FDA-approved procedure known for its precision and effectiveness.&nbsp; Let us first discuss the factors affecting the cost of </span><b>Contoura Super Vision Surgery Cost in India.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Choice of Hospital</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The choice of the hospital is one of the main factors affecting the cost of the Surgery. If the hospital is JCI accredited, NABH accredited, and comes under a brand name like Apollo or Fortis, then the cost of the surgery will be higher.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Location of the Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the hospital also impacts the overall cost of the surgery. If the hospital is located in the high-tier cities of India, like Delhi, Bangalore, or Mumbai, then the cost of the surgery will be more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Technology Used: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the main reasons why Contoura Vision is more expensive is the technology used. It requires a specialized robotic system that has advanced features like computerized eye tracking, cyclo rotation compensation, active centration control, visual axis treatment, and corneal irregularity correction. Since the machines used to perform the surgery are expensive, the procedure is also expensive.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Doctor’s fee: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">To operate the machine used to perform Contoura Vision, the surgeon requires special expertise. A surgeon with the expertise and skill needed to perform this surgery will charge more for the procedure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Pre-Operative Examination: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before performing Contoura Vision surgery, the surgeon performs several examinations like :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Visual Acuity Tests</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pentacam Tests</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eye Pressure Tests</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Retinal Tests</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of these exams is included in the surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Post-Surgery Care: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the surgery, the patient has to spend on:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow Up Visits</span></li>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Blade free cataract surgery all you need to know</strong></span></h2>
<p>Femtosecond laser cataract surgery is the latest and most advanced robotic technology for the treatment of cataracts, and it has significant advantages over traditional cataract surgery t.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why Robotic Femtosecond laser?</strong></span></p>
<p>When it comes to the technology used in femtosecond laser cataract surgery, India is at the forefront. Many of the hospitals and eye clinics in India are equipped with the latest femtosecond laser technology, which allows for more precise, fast and less invasive surgery. Actual working time of the laser is less than a minute.<br>
The femtosecond robot can perform some of the most critical steps of the surgery, such as creating corneal incisions and fragmenting the cataract, with greater accuracy and safety than traditional manual techniques. This leads to better visual outcomes, quicker recovery times, and a reduced risk of complications since it is 100% blade and suture free surgery.</p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Factors that Affect Robotic Cataract Surgery in India</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cataract surgeries have become faster and hassle free with the new technology that uses laser system to operate on cataract patients. Also known as robotic cataract surgery, this technology uses femtosecond laser machine and the incision into cornea is made using a robot. The whole surgery gets completed in 30 seconds. Here are some factors that effet the robotioc cataract surgery in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Severe Eye Conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients having severe eye condition like glaucoma , advanced diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration may not be suitable for robotic cataract surgery due to the risks involved in the surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Previous Eye Surgery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patinets who have undergone multiple eye surgeries or have had complications from previous surgeries, may not be the suitable candidate for the cataract surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Abnormalities in Cornea: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who have corneal abnormalieties like :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irregular astigmatism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corneal scarring&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thin corneas</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These people are not suitable candidate of the robotic cataract surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>General Health Conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients with significant health issues like&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncontrolled diabetes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypertension</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto immune disorders</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are not the suitable candidates of the robotic cataract surgery as these conditions slow down the healing and increase risk of complications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Mature Cataract: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mature cataract is an advanced stage of cataract development where the lens of the ye becomes clouded and leads to vision impairment. Performing robotic cataract surgery becomes difficult in such situations due to hard nature of lens. It becomes difficult for robotic system to remove cataract material in such cases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Small Non Dilating Pupil: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is a condition when pupil size is insufficiently large or fails to dilate during the surgical procedure. A small pupil will limit the access to the lens and thus make it challenging for the robot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Cost Factors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robotic Cataract surgery is more costly than traditional cataract surgery. If you considering it, you should take your financial condition in account and also check insurance coverage before opting this procedure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Cost of Robotic&nbsp; Cataract Surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>One of the primary advantages of undergoing femtosecond laser cataract surgery in India is the lower cost of treatment.<br>
India is known for providing world-class medical care at a fraction of the cost of other countries.<br>
The cost of femtosecond laser cataract surgery in India is much lower than in Western countries, making it a more affordable option for patients from around the world.<br>
The cost mainly depends on the technology used and type and make of Intra Ocular lenses (IOL). Indian made IOL is cheaper than American brands.<br>
In addition to this robotic and MICS are always expensive as they are painless, suture less surgeries.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Retinal Detachment Surgery in India: From Darkness to Light</span></h2>
<p>Retinal Detachment happens when your retina is pulled away from its normal position. A medical emergency should be treated immediately to protect your vision. Your retina must be attached to the back of your eye within a few days if it’s detached.</p>
<p>The retina is the innermost layer of our eye, which has two types of cells, namely rods and cones. When the retina is detached, it can no longer function, and the vision is lost. In this article, we will delve into retina surgery and why India is a popular destination to get this surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the causes of Retinal Detachment?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The most common reasons behind retinal Detachment are: </strong></span><br>
● Age-related shrinkage of vitreous gel, which can cause a tear in the retina<br>
● Eye injury<br>
● Cataract surgery<br>
● Diabetic retinopathy<br>
● Extreme nearsightedness<br>
● Eye disease like retinoschisis</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Detached Retina Symptoms</strong></span></p>
<p>Detachment of the retina is a serious eye condition that needs immediate medical attention. These are the most common symptoms of retinal detachment:</p>
<p>● Seeing flashes of light<br>
● Seeing a lot of floaters<br>
● Darkening of side vision<br>
● Darkening or shadow covering part of your vision</p>
<p>Knowing Different Types of Retinal Detachment</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There are three types of retinal Detachment:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Rhegmatogenous:</strong> </span>It is the most common type of retinal Detachment and usually occurs when you age. The tear in the retina causes vitreous humor to collect behind the retina, and the fluid pushes the retina away, thus detaching it from the back.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tractional:</strong></span> In this type of detached retina, the scar tissue pulls the retina away from the eye. The most common cause of it is diabetes. High blood sugar can damage the blood vessels in the eye and thus cause scar tissue.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Exudative:</strong> </span>in this type of retinal Detachment, the fluid builds behind the retainer even when there is no tear. The fluid pushes the retain away from the supporting tissue. The main reason behind the fluid build-up is the leaking blood vessels or selling behind the eye.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis and Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>The only way to diagnose retinal Detachment is with an eye exam. During your dilated eye exam, your eye doctor will check your retina. They’ll put drops in your eyes. Drops dilate the pupil. Your provider only takes a few minutes to see the retina up close.<br>
You might need other tests after your dilated eye exam. They’re non-invasive. They won’t hurt. Your provider can see your retina more clearly with them:<br>
● Optical coherence tomography (OCT)<br>
● Fundus imaging<br>
● Eye (ocular) ultrasound<br>
● Computed tomography (CT scan)</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment options available for Retinal Detachment</strong></span></p>
<p>The Retinal Detachment treatment options available for retinal Detachment include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pneumatic Retinopexy</strong></span></p>
<p>It is the simplest procedure that is used for repairing retinal Detachment. In this procedure, the surgeon injects the gas bubble into the vitreous humor and treats the tear with laser or cryotherapy. The bubble will press the retina, and freezing will stick the retina down. For the retina to remain in place after the operation, you must follow the doctor’s instructions carefully. The gas bubble will eventually disappear after days or weeks of the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Scleral Buckling</strong></span></p>
<p>The retinal tear is treated via cryotherapy. The fluid under the retina is drained, and silicone rubber is sutured to the eye’s outer wall. The silicone pushes the eye wall back onto the retina.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Vitrectomy Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Your doctor will do these things during a vitrectomy:<br>
● The vitreous is removed surgically.<br>
● Seals all tears or holes in the retina with laser or freezing.<br>
● It puts an air, gas, or oil bubble in the eye to push the retina back in.</p>
<p>If your provider uses them, oil bubbles will be removed after a few months. Your body reabsorbs gas and air bubbles. You may have to avoid certain activities if you have a gas bubble. Changes in altitude can make gas bubbles bigger and increase eye pressure. Avoid flying and traveling at high altitudes. Your provider will tell you when you can start these activities again.<br>
Understanding Retinal Detachment Treatment in India in Detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Preparation is key before retinal detachment surgery to ensure a successful outcome. The typical process before retinal detachment surgery is as follows:</p>
<p>● The eye doctor will conduct a comprehensive examination that may include a medical history, visual acuity testing, intraocular pressure measurements, and an examination of the retina with instruments such as a slit lamp and an ophthalmoscope.<br>
● A retinal detachment evaluation helps the ophthalmologist plan the appropriate surgical approach.<br>
● Diagnostic imaging, such as ultrasound or optical coherence tomography (OCT), may be performed to provide detailed retina images.<br>
● The ophthalmologist will discuss the diagnosis and the recommended surgical procedure with you.<br>
● Before the surgery, you will be asked to sign an informed consent form.<br>
● You will receive specific instructions from the surgical team regarding fasting before the procedure, any necessary medications, and how to prepare for surgery.<br>
● During retinal detachment surgery, the type of anesthesia may vary. You can get local anesthesia with sedation or general anesthesia. During surgery, the anesthesia choice will be discussed with you.<br>
● A surgeon will review your medical history and medications. Adjust or temporarily stop some medications before surgery to reduce bleeding risk.<br>
● In some cases, preoperative tests, like blood tests and electrocardiograms (ECGs), may be required, especially for people with underlying medical conditions.<br>
● Make sure you quit smoking and drinking before the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The surgery is performed under anesthesia. Local anesthesia will numb the eye, whereas general anesthesia will lead to unconsciousness during the surgery.<br>
● The surgeon will position you properly during the surgery.<br>
● In some cases, small incisions are used to access the inside part of the eye. In other cases, large incisions may be required.<br>
● If you undergo a vitrectomy, the surgeon will remove the gel inside the eye and access the detached retina.<br>
● The surgeon will then identify the retinal tear and use various methods to reattach it. These methods may include:<br>
● Scleral Buckling<br>
● Cryotherapy<br>
● Pneumatic Retinopexy<br>
● The surgeon will then close the incisions using sutures.<br>
● After the surgery, the eye is patched with a protective shield to prevent infection.<br>
After the Surgery</p>
<p>● You will be shifted to the recovery room after the surgery, where you will be monitored closely.<br>
● You will have to stay in the hospital overnight or even longer.<br>
● You may feel discomfort for several days to weeks after the surgery.<br>
● You will be given pain medications to relieve pain after the surgery.<br>
● You need to take proper rest after the surgery. Your eye surgeon will let you know when you can resume your daily activities after the surgery.<br>
● You have to wear an eye patch after the surgery.<br>
● If a bubble was put in your eye, you must keep your head in a certain position after the surgery. Your ophthalmologist will let you know about it.<br>
● You will see floaters and flashing lights a few weeks after the surgery. You may also notice the bubble in your eye.<br>
● You will start noticing improvements 6 weeks after the surgery.<br>
● You must attend follow-up visits with your doctor to ensure complete healing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks</strong></span></p>
<p>Risks and complications depend on the procedure used to treat retinal Detachment. Some complications that may occur include:<br>
● Cataract Formation<br>
● Glaucoma<br>
● Infection in the eyes<br>
● Hemorrhage<br>
● Vision loss</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>There are several advantages of retina surgery. The primary ones include:<br>
● Preservation of vision<br>
● Prevention of further damage to the eye<br>
● Improved quality of life<br>
● Quick recovery<br>
● Minimal discomfort<br>
● High success rates<br>
● Long term benefits<br>
● Reduced risk of complications</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Long Term Outlook</strong></span></p>
<p>In a country like India, which is emerging as a medical hub, nine out of 10 retinal detachments prove successful. The final success rate is over 95 percent. Your outlook depends on your vision’s clarity before the retinal Detachment, its extent, and other complicating factors. Your provider will tell you what type of improvement you can expect.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How can you prevent retinal Detachment?</strong></span></p>
<p>● Make sure you get regular eye exams: Your eyes are important. A good eye exam is especially important if you’re nearsighted. Retinal Detachment is more likely if you have myopia. A dilated eye exam can find small retinal tears.<br>
● Protect your eyes: Wear safety goggles or other eye protection when playing sports.<br>
● Ensure prompt treatment: If you notice detached retina symptoms, immediately see your eye doctor.<br>
● Take care of your overall health: Manage chronic conditions, eat right, and exercise.</p>
<p>If you improve your blood glucose levels and blood pressure, you can prevent diabetes-related tractional retinal Detachment.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Squint Surgery: Eyes Aligned, Confidence Redefined</span></h2>
<p>Many think squint is a permanent eye condition that cannot be corrected. But the truth is that the eye can be straightened at any age. A squint is also known as strabismus, where the eyes are not aligned in the same direction. In individuals with squint, the eyes do not point in the same direction simultaneously. One eye may turn inward, outward, upward, or downward while the other remains straight. This misalignment can be constant or intermittent. It can occur at any age.</p>
<p>This particular piece of article is for people who are dealing with squint eyes and are looking for treatment options in India. We will discuss eye squint surgery and why India is the best place to treat this condition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Squint</strong></span></p>
<p>There are several forms of strabismus. The most common is</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Accommodative Esotropia.</strong></span></p>
<p>This occurs in cases of uncorrected farsightedness. The ability to focus is linked to where our eyes point. When we try to put extra effort into keeping distant objects in clear focus, the eyes may turn inward.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Intermittent Exotropia</strong></span></p>
<p>is a type of strabismus in which one eye concentrates on the target, whereas the other eye points outwards.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Infantile Exotropia</strong></span></p>
<p>This type of squint occurs in children when infants show a significant amount of turning in of eyes before they are six months old.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Strabismus or squint can be defined in the following ways:</strong></span></p>
<p>Esotropia: Your eyes point inward.<br>
Exotropia: Your eyes point outward.<br>
Hypertropia: Your eyes point upward.<br>
Hypotropia: Your eyes point downward.<br>
Unilateral: It is always in the same eye.<br>
Alternating: It happens in one eye sometimes and in the other eye at times.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms of strabismus include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Double Vision<br>
● Tilting or turning your head<br>
● Headaches<br>
● Difficulty in reading<br>
● Eye strain<br>
● Closing or covering one eye when looking at nearby objects.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Causes of Squint in Children:</strong></span></p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Congenital Squint:</strong></span> A strong family history can lead to squint in children.<br>
●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Hypermetropia:</strong></span> Since the child cannot focus well, he has to put extra effort into focusing, which can cause double vision.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Childhood Illness:</strong></span> Squint may develop due to viral fever of measles<br>
● Injury to nerves<br>
● Hereditary</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Causes of Squint in Adults</strong></span></p>
<p>●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Muscle Imbalance:</strong> </span>The most common cause of squint is muscle imbalance, which makes it difficult for both eyes to work together.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Genetics:</strong> </span>A family history of squint also increases the chances of developing this condition.<br>
● Refractive Errors: Uncorrected vision problems like nearsightedness or farsightedness can also lead to squints in adults.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Underlying health conditions:</strong></span> Certain neurological conditions, head injuries, or brain tumors can also lead to squint.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lifestyle:</strong> </span>Prolonged screen time, stress, and poor lighting can lead to squinting.</p>
<p>Diagnosis of squint</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Eye specialists in India conduct the following tests to diagnose squint:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Medical history examination<br>
● Visual Acuity Test<br>
● Corneal Light Reflex<br>
● Cover test<br>
● Ocular Alignment and Motility Examination<br>
● Refraction Test</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Glasses or Contact Lenses:</strong> </span>If the squint is associated with refractive errors, such as nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism, the use of glasses and lenses is prescribed to restore vision and align the eyes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Vision Therapy and Eye Exercises:</strong></span> Vision therapy involves multiple eye exercises and activities designed to improve eye coordination and strengthen the eye muscles. This can be effective for certain types of squints, especially those related to convergence insufficiency.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prism Glasses:</strong></span> Prism glasses may be prescribed to help alleviate double vision by redirecting the light entering the eyes. These glasses can be especially beneficial for individuals with specific types of squint.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Botulinum Toxin (Botox) Injections:</strong></span> In some cases, particularly for certain types of strabismus, injections of botulinum toxin (Botox) may temporarily weaken specific eye muscles, allowing for improved alignment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery:</strong> </span>It is the main treatment option for squint in India. Squint surgery is recommended when other treatments fail to help. The operation involves moving the muscles to control eye movement so that the eyes align better.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Some terms related to Squint Surgery:</strong></span></p>
<p>You can have strabismus surgery on one or both eyes.</p>
<p>● Bilateral strabismus surgery is the term for when you have surgery on both eyes.<br>
● Resection is the term for making the muscle short by cutting it.<br>
● Plication is the term for making the muscle shorter by folding it over.<br>
● Recession refers to moving the muscle back to make it less tight.<br>
● You may have adjustable eye squint surgery, where doctors adjust the muscle sutures to correct for remaining misalignment in the recovery area or clinic soon after strabismus surgery in the operating room.</p>
<p>Understanding Squint Surgery in Detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span><br>
● You will have to take some pre-operative tests before the surgery that will determine your overall health.<br>
● If you have any history of past eye surgery, the doctors will review your reports.<br>
● Tell your doctor if you are on any specific medicines or blood thinners.<br>
● Tell your doctor if you are allergic to any medicine.<br>
● Stop eating or drinking just before the surgery. You are not supposed to take anything from your mouth after midnight. You also have to stop all your medications before the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The squint surgery starts by giving general anesthesia.<br>
● Your team will monitor your vitals during the surgery<br>
● The team will use an eye speculum to keep your eye open during the surgery<br>
● The surgeon will then cut into the outer white opening of your eye.<br>
● The doctor will then pull out the muscles and correct them using the above mentioned techniques.<br>
● Once done, the surgeon will attach the muscles and close your eye with dissolvable stitches.<br>
● The surgical team will remove the speculum and put ointment in the eye.<br>
● The surgery takes somewhere around 30 minutes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>The treated eye is covered with a pad. It’s usually removed the next day or before you leave.<br>
● You’ll probably have a sore eye for a few days.<br>
● Painkillers and eye drops may be given to ease discomfort.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>You may experience some of the following side effects after the surgery:</strong></span><br>
● eye pain<br>
● blood in your tears and watering eyes<br>
● itchy eyes<br>
● double vision.<br>
Contact your eye specialist as soon as possible if any of the side effects bother you.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Returning to normal activities</strong></span></p>
<p>Recovery from squint surgery can take several weeks. The care team will give you specific advice about returning to normal activities, but generally:</p>
<p>● When you feel okay, you can read, watch TV, and do other stuff.<br>
● It’ll take about a week to return to work or school.<br>
● Stay away from driving for at least a day or two or longer if you have double vision.<br>
● Avoid any soap or shampoo entering the eyes.<br>
● Start swimming or any other exercise only after six weeks of surgery.<br>
● Please do not put any makeup close to your eyes for at least four we<br>
● Most people return to exercise and sport after a week, although you may be advised to avoid swimming for four weeks and contact sports (such as rugby) for six weeks.<br>
● Do not use makeup close to the eyes for four weeks.<br>
● Regular follow-ups are necessary.<br>
● A balanced diet will improve healing.<br>
● In case of recurrence, a revision surgery is suggested.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks</strong></span></p>
<p>Risks are there in every operation. The risks associated with eye squint surgery include</p>
<p>● Further surgery to fully correct the squint if it is severe<br>
● Permanent double vision,<br>
● Infection in the eye<br>
● Eye muscles slipping out of position.<br>
● Loss of vision, but this is very rare.<br>
Speak to your doctor about the risks associated with the squint surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pediatric and squint surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Pediatric and squint surgery addresses misalignment in a child’s eyes, known as strabismus, aiming to improve vision and prevent long-term complications. Tailored to each child’s unique needs, this procedure enhances eye coordination, promoting optimal visual development. Early intervention is key, ensuring a brighter, clearer future for children facing squint-related challenges.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The primary advantages of squint surgery include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Improved eye alignment<br>
● Enhanced vision<br>
● Reduction in double vision<br>
● Cosmetic benefits<br>
● Correction of lazy eye<br>
● Enhanced life quality<br>
● Reduced eye strain</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>The prognosis for strabismus, commonly known as squint or crossed eyes, can vary depending on several factors. Here are some considerations:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Early Intervention:</strong> </span>Early detection of squint gives good outcomes; it helps to prevent amblyopia, also known as lazy eye.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Underlying Cause:</strong></span> The prognosis is affected by the underlying cause of the strabismus. Some cases may be related to refractive errors, muscle imbalances, or neurological factors<br>
.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Type and Severity of Strabismus:</strong></span> There are different types of strabismus, such as esotropia (inward turning) or exotropia (outward turning). The severity of the misalignment can also affect the prognosis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment Type:</strong></span> Surgical correction of strabismus is often successful, but the outcome can vary.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Compliance with Treatment:</strong></span> Treatment success also depends on the individual’s compliance with prescribed interventions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Age of the Individual:</strong></span> While strabismus can be treated at any age, it tends to give better results when treated in childhood.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Squint Prevention</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Squint prevention involves a combination of awareness and early intervention. Here is how you can prevent squint:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Regular eye checkups<br>
● Limit excessive screen time<br>
● Address any vision-related issues as soon as possible<br>
● Eye exercises can prevent squint<br>
● Take a nutritious and balanced diet</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Transformative Ptosis Correction: Discover Excellence in India.</span></h2>
<p>Ptosis is a condition when your eyelids droop over your eyes. This can impair your vision and can also lead to some serious complications. This condition can be present by birth and developed later in life. Another name for this condition is blepharoptosis, or droopy eyelid.<br>
Ptosis surgery is an operation that is done to tighten the muscles that will lift your upper eyelid. India is the right choice if you are struggling with sagging eyelids and looking for an affordable treatment. This section will discuss ptosis and how you can get its treatment in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Ptosis</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Congenital</strong></span></p>
<p>Congenital ptosis means that your child was born with this condition. Problems with the levator muscle lead to congenital ptosis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Acquired</strong></span></p>
<p>This type of eyelid ptosis affects adults in the later part of their life. This condition occurs when your levator muscles weaken or separate from your eyelid.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Causes</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The causes of ptosis vary from patient to patient. Numerous reasons can be behind ptosis. They can be:</strong></span></p>
<p>● AGING<br>
● EYE INJURY<br>
● MEDICAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS A STROKE, HORNER’S CONDITION, DIABETES, SKIN CANCER, OR STYE<br>
● SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH PTOSIS</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Other causes</strong></span></p>
<p>Other reasons for a droopy eyelid requiring ptosis surgery can include:<br>
● Injury to the upper eyelid muscle, including the levator muscle<br>
● Disease of the levator muscle and any other muscle that lifts the upper eyelid, such as myasthenia gravis<br>
● Damage to the nerve supplying the muscle that lifts the eyelid</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms</strong></span><br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>You can tell if your child is suffering from ptosis by the appearance of the eyelids. It may cover only your upper eye, but it can also cover your entire pupil. Other symptoms include: </strong></span><br>
● Excessive rubbing of eyes<br>
● Increased tearing<br>
● Impaired vision<br>
● Tiredness or achiness in the eyes<br>
● Eye strain or headache<br>
● Dry or watery eyes</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What happens if ptosis is not treated?</strong></span></p>
<p>If your child has congenital ptosis, you have to get it treated as soon as possible. Mild ptosis does not cause serious vision problems; no treatment is required. However, severe ptosis can lead to some severe complications.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Astigmatism</strong></span></p>
<p>It is a condition when your eyelid puts pressure on the front of your eye. It can change the shape of your eye. This can lead to problems in your vision.</p>
<p>Amblyopia</p>
<p>Eyelid Ptosis can also lead to lazy eyes.</p>
<p>Chin-up position</p>
<p>When your child has to tilt their chin up to be able to see beyond their drooping eyelids, it can cause neck problems, tighten forehead muscles, and developmental delays.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tests to diagnose ptosis include:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Slit lamp examination<br>
● Visual field testing<br>
● Eye movement test<br>
● Tensilon test</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment</strong></span></p>
<p>The treatment of eyelid lift in India depends on its cause and severity. It is essential to contact a professional ophthalmologist in India to determine the course of the treatment.<br>
Here are some treatment options available for ptosis in India:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Management</strong></span></p>
<p>If ptosis is mild, the doctors recommend conservative management. This involves monitoring the condition over time.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Eyelid crutches</strong></span></p>
<p>Eyelid crutches are for people who deal with mild ptosis. These devices are attached to eyeglasses and help lift the droopy eyelid.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Botulinum Toxin (Botox) Injections</strong></span></p>
<p>In some cases, particularly when the droopy eyelid is mild and caused by muscle weakness, botulinum toxin injections may be considered. Botox injections can help lift the eyelid by temporarily paralyzing the muscles and pulling them downward.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment for Congenital Ptosis</strong></span></p>
<p>For cases of congenital ptosis (present from birth), surgery is often the primary treatment option. The timing of surgery may vary depending on the individual case and the child’s overall health.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery is a common and effective treatment for moderate to severe ptosis. The different surgical techniques to correct ptosis are:</strong></span></p>
<p>Levator Resection involves shortening the levator muscles to lift the eyelid to the forehead.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Frontalis Sling Surgery:</strong></span> This surgery uses a sling to connect the eyelid to the forehead muscles.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Blepharoplasty:</strong></span> Ptosis surgery is combined with eyelid rejuvenation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment for Congenital Ptosis</strong></span></p>
<p>For cases of congenital ptosis (present from birth), surgery is often the primary treatment option. The timing of surgery may vary depending on the individual case and the child’s overall health.</p>
<p>Understanding surgery in detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The treatment will begin with a consultation with an experienced ophthalmologist and plastic surgeon.<br>
● It would help if you underwent a series of medical examinations to determine the underlying cause of ptosis.<br>
● If you smoke, stop smoking to reduce complications after the surgery.<br>
● Try to maintain a healthy weight. Risks increase if you are overweight.<br>
● Regular exercise will help you prepare for the operation.<br>
● When you come to the hospital, practice handwashing and wear a mask to avoid infection.<br>
● Talk to your healthcare provider about the medications you take. You will have to stop taking medications before the surgery.<br>
● Do not eat or drink anything before the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The eyelid surgery is performed under local or general anesthesia, depending on your preference.<br>
● The surgeon will make an opening in the skin of your upper eyelid.<br>
● The incision will help the surgeon to find the small muscle that raises your eyelid. He will then place stitches to tighten this muscle(levator) and raise your eyelid. The incision is then closed with the stitches.<br>
● If the levator muscle is extremely weak, the surgeon might attach or suspend the eyelid from smaller muscles in the eyebrow so the forehead muscles can lift.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● You will be closely monitored in the recovery area after the eyelid surgery.<br>
● It is common to experience some swelling and bruising in the initial days of the surgery.<br>
● You should be able to go home after a few hours.<br>
● Do not get your eyelid wet; exercise strenuously or bend until the stitches are removed.<br>
● Do not wear eye makeup or drink alcohol for a few weeks, and keep your face out of the sun.<br>
● Stay away from swimming for four weeks.<br>
● Regular exercise should help you to return to normal activities as soon as possible. Before exercising, ask the healthcare team or your GP for advice.<br>
● The results of ptosis surgery may take some time to become apparent fully.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complications</strong></span></p>
<p>● Infection of the surgical site<br>
● Allergic reaction to the equipment, materials, or medication<br>
● Chest infection<br>
● Over-correction, where your eyelid is lifted too high<br>
● Under-correction, where your eyelid is not lifted enough<br>
● Bleeding into your eye socket<br>
● Recurrent ptosis</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ptosis Prevention</strong></span></p>
<p>● Protect your eye from UV rays and dust<br>
● Take good eye care<br>
● Follow healthy lifestyle<br>
● Avoid eye strain<br>
● Take prompt treatment if you observe any change in your vision</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>The prognosis for ptosis depends on its underlying cause and the individual’s overall health. In cases where ptosis is age-related or due to muscle weakness, the condition may progress gradually. Surgical intervention often corrects the drooping eyelid and restores a more natural appearance.</p>
<p>For congenital eyelid ptosis (present from birth), the prognosis depends on the severity of the condition. Early intervention, such as surgery, is often recommended to improve visual development and prevent complications like amblyopia (lazy eye).</p>
<p>In cases where ptosis is associated with more serious underlying medical conditions, the prognosis may be influenced by the management of those conditions.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that eyelid surgery is generally considered safe and effective. However, like any surgical procedure, there are potential risks and complications. A qualified healthcare professional can provide a more accurate prognosis based on an individual’s circumstances. If you suspect or are diagnosed with ptosis, it’s advisable to consult with an ophthalmologist or a plastic surgeon for a personalized treatment plan.</p>

<div>● Vitreous humour is a gel-like substance made of 98 per cent water.</div>
<div>● A vitrectomy is an outpatient surgery that is performed in an eye hospital.</div>
<div>● The vitreous cavity gives the eye a round shape and makes up two-thirds of the volume of the eye.</div>

<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is the purpose?&nbsp;</strong></span></h3>
<div>A vitrectomy eye surgery is performed when your vitreous humour is infected, inflamed or filled with blood. It also helps to treat other conditions, like</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Bleeding inside your eye</div>
<div>● Eye infections</div>
<div>● Cataracts</div>
<div>● Injury in the retina,</div>
<div>● Detached retina</div>
<div>● Injury to the eye</div>
<div>● Diabetic retinopathy,</div>
<div>● Macular hole.</div>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Conditions treated by Vitrectomy</strong></span></h3>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Retinal Detachment:</strong></span> Your retina pulls away from the supporting tissue</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Posterior Vitreous Detachment:</strong> </span>Your vitreous gel will pull away.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diabetes-related retinopathy:</strong></span> Your retina’s blood vessels leak and grow abnormally.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Macula hole:</strong></span> Your macula has a hole in the middle.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Macula pucker:</strong></span> Wrinkles or creases on your macula.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Non-retinal conditions treated with Vitrectomy?</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Eye injury:</strong></span> Damage to your eye.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Endophthalmitis:</strong></span> An infection inside your eye.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tumours:</strong></span> Vitrectomy can be a way to biopsy a tumour in your eye.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lens issues:</strong></span> Doctors sometimes use Vitrectomy to address cataracts and dislocated lenses .</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Vitrectomy</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>The type of vitrectomy surgery your ophthalmologist will perform will depend on the eye condition you are suffering from. Different types of vitrectomy surgeries are</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Anterior Vitrectomy</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>You can undergo anterior Vitrectomy if there is leakage in the front part of your eye. The front part of your eye contains an iris and a lens. An ophthalmologist can easily perform an anterior vitrectomy, but you need a specialist to treat the posterior part of your eye.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Posterior Vitrectomy</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>This type of vitrectomy surgery will treat the posterior part of your eye. The posterior region of the eye contains the retina, retina pigment, choroid and sclera. It also contains vitreous humour. It is also called pars plana Vitrectomy.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding Vitrectomy Surgery in Detail</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the surgery</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>● You will meet an expert ophthalmologist or retina specialist to examine the eye condition and the type of vitrectomy surgery you need.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Ensure you discuss your medical history and tell them about your current medications.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Imaging tests will be performed to get detailed images of the retina.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Blood tests and other tests will be performed to track your overall health.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● You will then have a detailed discussion with the surgeon about the entire procedure. Make sure you ask about the complications and the outcomes of the surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● You will receive specific instructions about fasting before the surgery and stopping your usual medications.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● You will be given some antibiotics and dilating eye drops before the eye vitrectomy surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Ensure you arrange transportation after the surgery since you may experience blurry vision.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Vitrectomy Surgery Procedure</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>Talk with your retinal doctor about what to expect during your surgery. A doctor specially trained in retinal surgery will do your operation. In general, you can expect the following during the surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● The surgery begins by giving you anaesthesia eye drops to make sure that you do not feel anything during the surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● In some cases, people are given anaesthesia to put them to sleep during the surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your doctor will make an incision in the outer layer of the eye.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● The doctor will then make a small cut in the sclera, the white portion of the eye.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your eye doctor will then remove the vitreous, scar tissue, or any unwanted substance.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your eye doctor will do other required repairs to your eye. For example, they can use a laser to fix a tear in your retina. Sometimes, your eye doctor can inject a gas bubble into your eye so the retina stays in place.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your eye doctor will exchange the vitreous with other fluids, like silicone oil or saline.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your doctor may close your surgical incisions with stitches.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● An antibiotic ointment will be applied to your eye for any infection.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your eye will then be covered with a patch after the vitrectomy surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the surgery</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your ophthalmologist will prescribe you medicine that will heal your eye properly.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Pain is rare after the surgery, but you may feel scratchy, as if something is inside your eye. It will disappear with time and medicines.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● You must wear a patch on your eye for some time to protect it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● You will need to stay away from work for two to four weeks.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your healthcare team will tell you how to hold your head when awake and sleep in the correct position.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● Your eye will have redness after the surgery. It would help if you took medicines on time.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● You may experience imperfect or blurry vision after the surgery. It will get better as time passes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>● If a gas bubble is in your eye, you cannot fly, go to the mountains or do scuba diving until the gas bubble is gone.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you have silicone oil in your eye, you need another surgery later to remove it.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When to consult a doctor?&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Call your ophthalmologist immediately if:&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>● You experience severe pain</div>
<div>● Signs of infection</div>
<div>● Worsening vision</div>
<div>● Other disturbing symptoms.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the risks?&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Some risks of the vitrectomy surgery procedure include&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>● Infection,</div>
<div>● Excess Bleeding,</div>
<div>● High pressure in the eye</div>
<div>● Lens damage,</div>
<div>● Increased rate of cataract formation</div>
<div>● Problems with eye movement,</div>
<div>● Change in refractive error.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery might not fix your original problem. You might need a repeat surgery if that’s the case.</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What are the advantages?&nbsp;</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>● Treats retinal disorders</div>
<div>● Improves vision</div>
<div>● Treats vitreous haemorrhage</div>
<div>● Treats macular hole</div>
<div>● Diabetic retinopathy management</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Outlook and Prognosis</strong></span></div>
<div></div>
<div>A vitrectomy is a low-risk, high-result procedure for treating many eye problems.</div>
<div>Sometimes, your vision may improve if you’ve been cloudy or blurry due to substances or blood in your vitreous. If you have this procedure done, talk to your doctor about what to expect.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Success in Treating Underlying Conditions: Vitrectomy is often performed to address retinal detachment, macular holes, diabetic retinopathy, and vitreous haemorrhage. The prognosis is typically positive when the surgery successfully addresses the underlying issue and improves or stabilises vision.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Visual Improvement:</strong></span> Many individuals experience improved vision following Vitrectomy, especially if the surgery is successful.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Complications and Risks:</strong></span> While Vitrectomy is generally considered safe, it does carry some risks, including infection, bleeding, increased intraocular pressure, and the development of cataracts. The prognosis may be affected if complications arise during or after surgery.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Post-Operative Care:</strong></span> Adherence to post-operative care instructions is crucial for a positive prognosis. Patients are typically advised to use prescribed medications, attend follow-up appointments, and avoid activities that may strain the eyes during the initial recovery period.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Underlying Health Conditions</strong></span>: The patient’s overall health can impact the prognosis. Diabetes or hypertension may influence the healing process and overall outcomes.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Recovery Time:</strong></span> The recovery duration can vary based on the specific procedure and the individual’s overall health. Some people may experience a relatively quick recovery, while others may require a more extended period for full healing.</div>
<div></div>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery in India</span></h2>
<p>Coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) or heart bypass surgery is a procedure in which healthy blood vessels are taken from other part of the body and connected above and below the blocked artery. This ensures improved blood flow to the heart and significantly lowers the risk of a heart attack by creating a new route for the blood to flow.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Minimally Invasive – Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (MICS CABG)</span></h2>
<p>This is a much newer and advanced technique of performing coronary bypass for the&nbsp;treatment of coronary heart disease. In this technique, a small 4 – 6 cm incision is made on the left side of the chest. This incision is used to approach the heart through the ribs without cutting any bones and the surgery is performed using laproscopy. The different techniques used are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minimally Invasive – Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB)</li>
<li>Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB)</li>
<li>Totally Endoscopic, <strong>Robot-Assisted Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting</strong> (TECAB)</li>
</ul>
<p>Few hospitals in India follow a new technique and take artery grafts from chest and leg vein are taken only if many grants are needed. This saves the additional incision to the leg and faster recovery. Arterial grafts (mostly radial artery) are considered to be most durable grafts of this approach.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Advantages of Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery over the traditional CABG:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The biggest advantage of this technique is that, since no bones are cut, there is lesser pain and minimal impact on retaining function and breathing.</li>
<li>Shorter hospital stay i.e. usually the procedure lasts only 5 days unlike the conventional heart surgery that takes 9 days and hence the return to normal life is faster and easier.</li>
<li>Lesser blood loss eliminates the need for blood transfusion and hence no risk of any blood borne infections</li>
<li>Due to a small cut the risk of all infections is significantly reduced. Making this technique ideal for high risk patients such as diabetics and older patients with weaker resistance to infections.</li>
<li>Since the incision is just 2 – 3 inches it leaves a very small scar.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Limitations of Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Since this is a new technique it requires specialised surgeons and at specialised hospitals.</li>
<li>The procedure is expensive compared to the traditional CABG</li>
<li>Strict patient selection criteria. Patients with extensive disease or very poor heart function are not suitable for this technique.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Endoscopic Vein Harvesting (EVH)</span></h2>
<p>EVH adds further benefit to MICS CABG. State of the art equipment ensures quality with exceptional patient comfort. In this technique the leg vein is harvested to be used as a bypass conduit using an endoscope. Many studies have reported, that endoscopic vein-graft harvesting reduces post-operative pain, wound complications, duration of hospital stay, and a need for a large longitudinal incision.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Redo CABG’s</span></h2>
<p>Redo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) occurs when patients who previously underwent CABG develop progression of their native coronary artery disease or graft occlusion that requires another surgical revascularization.</p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Factors Affecting the Overall Cost of the Treatment CABG:&nbsp;</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of CABG surgery is very high in Western countries.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">India is known worldwide for its advanced medical facilities and promising technology for CABG surgery.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average cost of surgery in India is less than that of Western countries.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average cost of coronary Artery Bypass Surgery is around $ 4000 to $ 5500.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>The various deciding factors that affect the total cost are:&nbsp;</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Hospital Factors:&nbsp;</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type of Hospital( government or private)&nbsp;</span></li>

</ul>
<p><b>Duration of the Hospital Stay: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of the hospitalization affects the overall cost. Prolonged stay due to complications or other medical conditions may increase the overall cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, the type of room selected for the stay determines the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Pre-operative Costs: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the surgery, extensive evaluations are conducted to assess the patient’s condition. These evaluations may involve tests, consultations, and imaging studies. The cost of the evaluations is based on their complexity and the number of tests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Post-operative Care: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">After coronary artery bypass surgery, patients require post-operative care like medications, monitoring, and follow-up care. The duration and the intensity of post-operative care can impact the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimal Invasive Cardiac Surgery (CABG) in India: Transforming Heart Surgeries with Precision and Safety</strong></span></h2>
<p>MICS Bypass Surgery stands for “Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.” It is a specialized surgical technique used to treat blocked or narrowed coronary arteries in a less invasive manner compared to traditional open-heart coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery</p>
<p>Like all body organs, the heart also needs a constant blood supply. The blood is supplied via two large blood vessels, the left and right coronary arteries. However, these arteries become narrow and hardened over time by depositing fatty acids known as plaques. This is known as atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>People suffering from this disease are said to have coronary heart disease. The best treatment option in India to treat coronary heart disease is Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, also known as CABG. A coronary artery bypass gives blood a new route around a blocked artery. A healthy blood vessel is taken from the chest or leg during surgery. This vessel is connected below the blocked artery. A new pathway improves blood flow to the heart</p>
<p>Let us know more about this surgery in India and how it is transforming people’s lives in India and around the globe. Continue reading to know more about it:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who are at risk of developing Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Your chances of developing coronary heart disease increase with age. However, you can also develop it if:<br>
● You smoke<br>
● You are obese<br>
● You have a high-fat diet</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease</strong></span></p>
<p>Symptoms of coronary artery disease may include:<br>
● Chest pain<br>
● Fatigue<br>
● Palpitations<br>
● Abnormal heart rhythms<br>
● Shortness of breath<br>
● Swelling in hands<br>
● Indigestion</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who needs Coronary Artery Bypass surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p>CABG is done to restore the blood flow around the blocked artery. The surgery is done as an emergency treatment for a heart attack. It may also be recommended in the following situations:</p>
<p>● You have a severe blockage in the left artery as it supplies maximum blood to the heart<br>
● Severe narrowing in the main heart artery<br>
● Severe chest pain<br>
● More than one blocked heart artery<br>
● A blocked heart artery that cannot be treated by angioplasty<br>
● Angioplasty with or without a stent that has not worked.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Imaging and Lab Tests</strong></span></p>
<p>The potential tests you can undergo before the surgery are:<br>
● ECG or EKG<br>
● Echocardiogram<br>
● Exercise stress test<br>
● Nuclear cardiac stress test<br>
● Cardiac catheterization<br>
● CT scan<br>
● Coronary Calcium Scan</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Treatment of Coronary Artery Disease in India: Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( MICS-CABG)</strong></span></h2>
<p>This is the latest treatment option available in India for treating patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Unlike traditional CABG, it is a specialized coronary artery bypass grafting technique with small incisions and reduced trauma. The different techniques used to perform MICS-CABG in India are:</p>
<p><strong>Direct Coronary Artery Bypass (MIDCAB):</strong> MIDCAB involves making a small incision between the ribs on the left side of the chest. Unlike conventional CABG, this doesn’t require splitting the breastbone (sternotomy). The MIDCAB avoids sternotomy, so there is less trauma to the chest, and the patient may recover faster.</p>
<p><strong>Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass (OPCAB):</strong> This surgical technique can relieve narrowed or blocked coronary arteries and is an alternative to Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG). Compared to traditional CABG surgery, OPCAB does not use a heart-lung machine.</p>
<p><strong>Robot-Assisted Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting (TECAB):</strong> This is an advanced technique used to perform coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs). It’s a minimally invasive approach using robotics and endoscopic instruments to reach the coronary arteries.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Knowing Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery ( MICS-CABG) In Detail</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● It would help if you underwent a thorough medical evaluation to determine your overall health.<br>
● Any pre-existing medical condition is identified to increase the impact of the surgery.<br>
● You will have an in-depth conversation with your cardiac surgeon to determine the risks and benefits of the surgery.<br>
● Your current medications may be temporarily adjusted or stopped to reduce any complications in the surgery.<br>
● You will be given pre-operative instructions, including fasting before the surgery and avoiding certain medications (potent anticoagulants)<br>
● Please quit smoking and drinking before the surgery to avoid complications.<br>
● The anesthesiologist will discuss the risks associated with anesthesia with you.</p>
<p><strong>During the Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● Anesthesia: During surgery, the patient is given general anesthesia to make sure they’re unconscious<br>
● Minimal Incision: A thoracoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera) and specialized instruments are inserted through small incisions in the chest.<br>
● Visualization: The thoracoscope shows the heart and its internal structures on a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to see the surgical site clearly and perform the procedure correctly.<br>
● Grafting: The surgeon can use an artery from another body part as the graft, like the internal mammary or radial artery. A small incision in the arm or leg can also harvest the artery endoscopically.<br>
● Closing: Surgeons use specialized instruments to graft the healthy artery onto the blocked coronary artery, creating a new path for blood to flow.<br>
● Once the bypass graft is placed, the surgeon ensures the bypass graft is working, and the blood flow to the heart muscles is back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>After the Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● After the surgery, you will be taken to the ICU.<br>
● You may experience pain after the surgery. Hence an important part of the surgery is pain management.<br>
● You will be closely observed weekly with frequent heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen level checks.<br>
● After four days, you can start routine activities like sitting in bed, walking short distances, etc.<br>
● Since the incision during the surgery is small, it requires less wound care.<br>
● You can also start cardiovascular rehabilitation after your hospital stay.<br>
● The length of hospital stay is comparatively less in MICS-CABG.<br>
● Follow post-operative instructions by a surgical team once you reach home.<br>
● Individual experiences can vary, so consult your surgeon for a personalized experience.</p>
<p><strong>Long term outcomes</strong></p>
<p>Most patients do well with Minimally Invasive Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery (MICS-CABG). It improves blood flow to blocked or narrowed coronary arteries by revascularizing the heart. Long-term benefits of MICS-CABG include:<br>
● Improves quality of life by improving chest pain and shortness of breath.<br>
● Prevents future heart attacks and strokes by restoring blood flow to the heart and brain.<br>
● It can boost your exercise capacity and cardiovascular health.<br>
● MICS-CABG bypass grafts last for years, so patients get long-lasting benefits.<br>
● It may reduce the need for certain medications to manage coronary artery disease, but patients will still have to take blood pressure and cholesterol medications.<br>
● Early returning to their regular activities, including work, exercise, and hobbies, with the guidance of their healthcare team.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Sites Of Graft in MICS-CABG</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>The grafts are usually obtained from healthy blood vessels elsewhere in the body. The most common sites of graft in MICS-CABG are:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>● Internal Mammary Artery: It is inside the chest and runs parallel to the breastbone.<br>
● Radial Artery: It is located in the forearm and is often used as a graft in MICS-CABG.<br>
● Saphenous Vein: It is a superficial vein located in the left and used in traditional CABG and MICS-CABG.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Arterial Vs. Venous Graft</strong></span></p>
<p>● Arterial Grafts, particularly the internal mammary artery, have long-term patency rates, leading to improved graft durability and reducing chances of blockage.<br>
● Venous grafts, on the other hand, such as saphenous veins, are easier to harvest and suitable for grafting multiple coronary arteries.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery over the traditional CABG:</strong></span></p>
<p>● The biggest advantage of this method is that no bones are cut, so there’s less pain and less impact on your breathing.<br>
● Unlike conventional heart surgery, which takes nine days, this procedure takes only five days so that you can return to normal life quicker.<br>
● With less blood loss, you don’t need blood transfusions, and you don’t get blood-borne diseases.<br>
● Patients may not experience post-surgical anemia due to blood loss.<br>
● There’s a big reduction in infection risks due to a small cut. It’s perfect for people with diabetes and older patients with weakened immune systems.<br>
● It leaves a very small scar since the incision is just 2 – 3 inches long</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The limitations of minimally invasive cardiac surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● It requires specialized surgeons and specialized hospitals since this is a new technique.<br>
● Compared to the traditional CABG, this is more expensive.<br>
● Patients are selected based on strict criteria. This technique isn’t for patients with extensive disease or low heart function.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Endoscopic Vein Harvesting (EVH)</strong></span></p>
<p>Endoscopic Vein Harvesting refers to harvesting a healthy vein from a patient for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. A tiny incision in the leg is used to insert an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera). An endoscope provides a magnified view of the saphenous Vein’s insides so the surgeon can carefully dissect and remove it. The advantage of this procedure is:<br>
● Small incisions<br>
● Faster recovery<br>
● Reduced risk of complications<br>
● Enhanced visualization<br>
● Improved patient satisfaction</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Valve replacement surgery in India: Giving Heart a Second Chance</span></h2>
<p>Heart valve surgery is a procedure used to treat heart valve disease. The main function of a heart valve is to keep the blood flowing in the correct direction.</p>
<p><strong>Our heart has four valves:</strong><br>
● Mitral valve<br>
● Tricuspid valve<br>
● Pulmonary valve<br>
● Aortic valve</p>
<p>These valves have flaps and should open and close once during each heartbeat. However, if one or more valves fail to do so, then a person needs valve replacement surgery. Here we will discuss India’s most famous Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery. This technique can be used for MVR (Mitral Valve Replacement) and AVR (Aortic Valve Replacement) procedures. Let us delve into the details of the procedure and let us know which top hospitals in India perform this procedure.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why is the Surgery done?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Heart valve surgery is done to treat heart valve disease. There are two types of heart valve problems:</strong><br>
● Stenosis, which is a narrowing of a valve<br>
● A leak in the valve makes the blood flow backward</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Symptoms of diseased or damaged valve</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Symptoms of damaged or diseased heart valves include:</strong><br>
● Feeling dizzy<br>
● Pain in the chest<br>
● Having trouble breathing<br>
● Feeling palpitations<br>
● Edema (swelling) of the feet, ankles, or belly<br>
● Gaining weight quickly because of fluid retention</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Valve Repair Vs. MICS Valve Replacement Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Heart valve surgery comes in two types:</strong></p>
<p>● Valve repair surgery preserves much of the patient’s tissue while fixing the damaged or faulty valve. Mostly mitral valves are repaired, but aortic and tricuspid valves can be repaired too.<br>
● Valve replacement surgery removes the old, faulty valve and replaces it with a new one made from either human tissue or metal.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Valve Replacement Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● Aortic Valve Replacement ( AVR): Aortic valve on the left side of the heart serves as an outflow valve. It lets blood leave the left ventricle, the heart’s main pumping chamber. It also prevents blood from leaking back into the left ventricle. In case of stenosis or regurgitation of the aortic valve, you may require Surgery.</p>
<p>● Mitral Valve Replacement (MVR): The heart’s mitral valve is on the left side. It acts as an inflow valve. It allows blood to flow into the left ventricle from the left atrium. If the valve doesn’t fully open or close, Surgery may be required.</p>
<p>● Double Valve Replacement: A double valve replacement replaces the mitral and aortic valves or the left side. This one has a higher mortality rate than other kinds of surgeries.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Imaging and Lab Tests</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Imaging and lab tests required for single valve replacement surgery are:</strong><br>
● TEE<br>
● Cardiac CT Scan<br>
● Cardiac MRI</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery: Understanding the Details</strong></span></h2>
<p>It involves smaller incisions, advanced imaging techniques, and specialized instruments to access and replace damaged heart valves. This allows surgeons to operate on the heart without having open-heart surgery. Both mitral valve replacement (MVR) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) surgeries can be performed using minimally invasive techniques.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>●<strong> TAVR:</strong>TAVR stands for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement, in which a catheter is threaded through a blood vessel to the heart to position a new artificial valve inside.<br>
●<strong> TMVR:</strong> It stands for Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement. In this, a catheter is guided through a blood vessel to the heart’s mitral valve to replace it.<br>
● <strong>Mini Sternotomy:</strong> An aortic or mitral valve replacement is done through a small incision in the upper part of the breastbone.<br>
● <strong>Robot-Assisted Heart Valve Surgery</strong> is an advanced technology combining minimally invasive techniques. This approach uses robotic arms to improve precision and agility, hence better results.</p>
<p><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● Ask questions to your healthcare provider related to Surgery.<br>
● Sign a consent form if you agree to the Surgery.<br>
● During a complete medical history and physical exam, your healthcare provider will ensure that you are otherwise healthy before Surgery.<br>
● Before the procedure, fast for 8 hours (without eating or drinking).<br>
● Let your healthcare provider know if you are pregnant.<br>
● You should inform your healthcare provider if you are allergic to any medicines, iodine, latex, tape, or anesthetic agents.<br>
● Tell your healthcare provider if you have a history of bleeding disorders or are taking anticoagulants (blood-thinning) or aspirin. These medicines have to be stopped four days before Surgery.<br>
● Before Surgery, your healthcare provider may test your blood’s clotting time.<br>
● If you have a pacemaker, let your healthcare provider know.<br>
● Smokers should stop smoking immediately. It improves your chances for successful surgery recovery and overall health.<br>
● Your healthcare provider may request additional preparations if you have a medical condition</p>
<p><strong>During the Surgery</strong></p>
<p>Anesthesia: General anesthesia is administered in the operating room to induce unconsciousness and pain relief during Surgery.</p>
<p>Incision: Small incisions are made when performing minimally invasive valve surgery. A small incision (Generally 4-6 cm long) is typically made on the side of the chest (right or left) or in the middle of the chest.</p>
<p>Access to the Heart: The surgeon accesses the heart through a small incision. The rib cage may be moved temporarily for better visualization and access to the heart valves.</p>
<p>Cardiopulmonary Bypass (Heart-Lung Machine): A heart-lung machine controls the heart and lungs during Surgery, allowing the surgeon to halt the heart temporarily.</p>
<p>Replacement of valves: A prosthetic heart valve replaces the diseased valve. A prosthetic valve can either be mechanical (made of durable materials) or biological (usually made of animal tissue).<br>
Analysis and adjustment: The surgeon carefully assesses and adjusts the new valve after installation to ensure proper blood flow and function.</p>
<p>The Restart and Chest Closure: The heart-lung machine will eventually be disconnected, and the heart will restart. Incisions are then closed with sutures or staples.</p>
<p><strong>After The Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● As soon as the Surgery is over, you’ll be shifted to the recovery room and the intensive care unit (ICU).<br>
● Nurses will connect you to machines that will continuously display your electrocardiogram tracing, blood pressure, breathing rate, and oxygen saturation.<br>
● Your throat will be attached to a ventilator until you can breathe independently.<br>
● In case of pain, you’ll get pain medicine.<br>
● You may need IV (intravenous) medicines to control your blood pressure, heart, and bleeding problems.<br>
● You can start drinking liquids as soon as your breathing and stomach tubes are removed. Solid foods can be eaten as soon as you can tolerate them.<br>
● You will be moved from the ICU to a surgical unit upon your healthcare provider’s approval.<br>
● Your activity will gradually increase as you get out of bed and walk around for longer.<br>
● After you are discharged from the hospital, usually 5 – 6 days , your healthcare team will arrange a follow-up appointment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Mechanical Vs. Biological Valve</strong></span></p>
<p>● Mechanical valves are created from carbon and polyester that are well tolerated by the human body. They can last between 10 to 20 years. However, if you choose a mechanical valve, you must take blood thinners to reduce the risk of stroke.</p>
<p>● Biological valves, on the other hand, are created from human or animal tissue. They are of three types:<br>
● A homograft made from a human donor heart<br>
● Porcine valve made from pig tissue<br>
● A bovine valve made from cow tissue</p>
<p>These valves do not increase the risk of blood clots, so you do not have to be blood thinners. However, their life is shorter compared to mechanical valves. Your surgeon will recommend the type of valve,</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Advantages of Minimally Invasive Heart Valve Replacement Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>It offers several advantages over traditional open-heart Surgery:</strong><br>
● A smaller incision<br>
● Shorter hospital stays.<br>
● Less postoperative pain and a faster overall recovery process<br>
● Lower complications, such as bleeding, infection, and blood clots.<br>
● Improved quality of life.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks Associated with the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Risks come with any surgery. There are a few risks associated with heart valve surgery:</strong><br>
● Heart attack.<br>
● Failure of the heart.<br>
● Heart rhythm problems – you might need a pacemaker.<br>
● Stroke.<br>
● Infection.<br>
● Bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>Before your Surgery, your cardiologist and surgeon will discuss these risks with you.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Why India?</strong></span></p>
<p>India offers affordable, minimally invasive heart valve surgery compared to many Western countries. It depends on the hospital, the surgeon’s fees, the specific technique used, and the patient’s health. Compared to countries like the U.S. or U.K., minimally invasive heart valve surgery in India costs significantly less, so it’s an appealing option for international patients.</p>

			<h2><strong>Double Valve Replacement Surgery in India: Advancing Cardiac Care</strong></h2>
<p>With the advancement in cardiovascular Surgery, medical professionals in India can now perform very complex procedures with utmost precision. Double valve replacement surgery is one such procedure that gives a new life to a patient suffering from severe valve disease. In this article, we will look more into the intricacies of double valve replacement surgery, its importance, how the procedure is performed, and what is best to get the valve replacement Surgery done in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Understanding Double Valve Replacement Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Human hearts have four valves that ensure unidirectional blood flow, ensuring optimal circulation. Many conditions can damage heart valves, like congenital anomalies, degenerative changes, infections, and rheumatic fever. A double valve replacement is necessary when the aortic and mitral valves are severely damaged.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Significance of Double Valve Replacement</strong></span></p>
<p>The double valve replacement surgery restores normal blood flow and improves heart function. If both aortic and mitral valves are damaged, the heart’s pumping efficiency is severely reduced, causing shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and edema. Leaving this condition untreated can cause heart failure and reduce the quality of life. A double valve replacement surgery can help relieve these symptoms, improve overall health, and prolong your life.</p>

● Cardiac MRI</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Types of Double Valve Replacement Surgery Performed in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>Double valve replacement surgery involves the removal of the aortic valve and mitral valve and its replacement with prosthetic valves. The procedure is performed in India using two ways:</p>
<p><em><strong>Traditional Open Heart Surgery</strong></em></p>
<p>In traditional open-heart Surgery, the patient is under general anesthesia. A large incision is made in the chest to reach the heart. You will be connected to a heart-lung machine, and the surgeon will then remove the diseased aortic and mitral valves to replace them with prosthetic ones.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #000000;">Minimally Invasive Double Valve Surgery</span></em></strong></p>
<p>A minimally invasive double valve replacement reduces surgical trauma, shortens recovery time, and improves cosmetic outcomes. The procedure uses smaller incisions, specialized instruments, and advanced imaging.</p>
<p>One technique is robotic-assisted Surgery, where the surgeon controls robot arms to make small incisions. Another way to get to the heart is through thoracoscopic Surgery. These two techniques offer benefits like reduced blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● You can ask your healthcare provider questions about Surgery.<br>
● You’ll need to sign a consent form if you’re going in for Surgery.<br>
● Before Surgery, your healthcare provider will make sure you’re healthy otherwise.<br>
● Wait to eat or drink for 8 hours before the procedure.<br>
● If you’re pregnant, let your doctor know.<br>
● Please let your healthcare provider know if you’re allergic to any medicines, iodine, latex, tape, or anesthetics.<br>
● Be sure your healthcare provider knows if you’ve had bleeding disorders or if you take anticoagulants (blood thinners) or aspirin. You have to stop these medicines four days before Surgery.<br>
● Your healthcare provider might test your blood’s clotting time before Surgery.<br>
● Tell your doctor if you have a pacemaker.<br>
● Stop smoking right away if you’re a smoker. It improves your chances of a successful surgery recovery.<br>
● Your healthcare provider may ask you to make additional preparations.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During The Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● You will be under general anesthesia to ensure you are asleep during the procedure.<br>
● The surgeon will then make small incisions in the chest ( sternum or right side of the chest) to access the heart and valves.<br>
● In minimally invasive heart surgery, the incisions are designed to be small while still allowing access to necessary structures within the chest. Smaller incisions may range from a few centimeters to 5-8 centimeters in length (about 2-3 inches).<br>
● The minimally invasive technique involves two approaches:<br>
● The thoracic approach involves the insertion of a thoracoscope ( a tube with a camera at the end) to give the surgeon a magnified view.<br>
● In some instances, surgeons in India use a robotic approach, where the surgeon’s movements are translated into precise motions of the robotic arms to increase agility. Since this approach gives a 3D view, the prosthetic valves are placed accurately.<br>
● Once the surgeon reaches the heart, the prosthetic ones replace the two valves. The valves are attached to the heart using sutures or other fixing methods.<br>
● In some cases, the surgeon may also place you on a heart-lung machine, which takes over the heart’s function while the heart is not working.<br>
● After the replacement, the incisions are closed with sutures.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>Immediately post-op:</strong></em></p>
<p>● You will be monitored in the CTVS ICU room as the anesthesia wears off after Surgery.<br>
● The hospital staff will monitor your vital signs, like heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen levels.<br>
● To make sure you are comfortable, pain medications are administered.</p>
<p><em><strong>During your hospital stay:</strong></em></p>
<p>● Hospital stay is typically shorter than traditional open heart surgery, usually a week.<br>
● Moving and walking immediately is essential to prevent complications like blood clots.<br>
● As your condition stabilizes, IV lines and catheters can be removed.<br>
● Cardiac monitoring keeps tabs on your heart’s function.<br>
● If you’re using chest tubes, remove them once the drainage is acceptable.<br>
● Some patients start physical therapy to regain strength and mobility.</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;"><em><strong>Recovering at home after discharge:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>● You will be discharged when you can walk, manage daily activities, and have stable vital signs.<br>
● Pain relievers, antibiotics, and blood thinners might be prescribed.<br>
● Increase activity gradually while avoiding strenuous tasks.<br>
● Follow-up appointments with the surgeon and cardiologist are essential for monitoring your progress.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The long-term recovery process:</strong></span></p>
<p>● A cardiac rehabilitation program guides patients through structured exercises and lifestyle adjustments.<br>
● For long-term cardiac health, it’s essential to eat a heart-healthy diet.<br>
● Follow your prescribed medications strictly, including anticoagulants if needed.<br>
● Depending on the job’s demands, you can return to work within a few weeks to a few months.<br>
● For the initial recovery phase, you should avoid crowded places and follow hygiene practices.<br>
● Regular checkups with the doctors will monitor your heart, valves, and overall health.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Coping and emotional support:</strong></span></p>
<p>● The emotional support of family, friends, and support groups can make a big difference in recovery.<br>
● Emotional challenges can arise from lifestyle changes and Surgery; counseling or therapy can help.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>A look at the long-term:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Successful recovery can lead to reduced symptoms, increased energy levels, and improved quality of life.<br>
● Lifelong follow-ups are needed to monitor the health of your replaced valves and your heart.</p>

			<h2>Valve Replacement Surgery in JCI Accredited Hospitals in India</h2>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is Valve Replacement Surgery?</span></h2>
<p>Valve replacement surgery is a procedure to remove impaired heart valve and replace it with a mechanical (metal or carbon) or a biological (pig, cow or human tissue) valve.</p>
<p>This surgery is required in patients who have heart valve disease. Heart valve disease leads to at least one of the four heart valves (namely Aortic valve, Mitral valve, Tricuspid valve and Pulmonary valve)to not function properly. The two basic heart valve problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A narrowing of a valve (stenosis)</li>
<li>A leakage in a valve allowing backward flow of blood (regurgitation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The type of heart valve surgery needed (replacement or repair) depends on various factors, including age, health, and the type and severity of heart valve disease.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Types of Heart Valves</span></h2>
<p><strong>Mechanical Valves</strong>: Mechanical valves are made up of carbon and polyester and could last around 10- 20 years. They are usually well tolerated by the human body however one of the risks associated with mechanical valves is blood clots. To counter this, the patient would be required to take blood thinners for the rest of his/her life to reduce the risk of stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Biological valves</strong>: Biological or Bio-prosthetic valves are made up of human or animal tissue. They are usually of three types:</p>
<ol>
<li>Human Tissue: A tissue graft taken from a donated human heart.</li>
<li>Bovine Tissue: A tissue graft taken from bovine (cow) tissue. Usually connected to the heart using a silicone rubber.</li>
<li>Porcine Tissue: A tissue graft taken from Porcine (pig) tissue. This can be implanted with or without a frame called a stent.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since biologic valves don’t increase the risk of developing blood clots hence a patient would not be required to take blood thinners for life. However, the lifespan of a bio-prosthetic valve is not as long as a mechanical one and hence may require replacement at a future date.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Type of Surgical Procedures</span></h2>
<p>Apart from the traditional open heart surgery the two new approaches used in valve replacement are:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Minimally invasive cardiac surgery (MICS)/ Surgical aortic valve replacement&nbsp;(SAVR);</strong></span></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Percutaneous or trans-aortic valve replacement&nbsp;(PAVR / TAVR):</strong>Catheter assisted replacement of the aortic valve is a minimally invasive option for those suffering from&nbsp;aortic valve stenosis. It is performed by guiding a catheter from the groin to the narrowed valve via the aorta using real-time x-ray technology. A metal stent containing a valve is then deployed using a balloon to press the stent into the valve in effect opening the stenosed (or narrowed) valve and lodging the stent in place.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Robot-assisted heart valve surgery: </strong>The minimally-invasive robotically-assisted technique uses even smaller incisions – often less than 2 inches. The surgeon’s hands control the movement and placement of the endoscopic instruments to open the pericardium (thin sac that surrounds the heart) and to perform the procedure. In most cases, the sternum or breastbone does not need to be opened and the ribs do not need to be spread to perform the procedure.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Heart Valve Replacement Surgery in India: Factors Affecting Cost</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of heart valve replacement surgery is cheaper in India than in the majority of the countries in the world. This is primarily because of the Excellent facilities for cardiac surgeries and the fact that valves used for the surgery are mainly manufactured and available within the country’s boundaries.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By giving the highest quality medical treatment at an affordable cost, India has established itself as one of the most popular hubs to get therapy from around the world. It is primarily known for all cardiac surgery, including cardiac bypass, heart valve replacement, coronary angioplasty bypass grafting (CABG) and other heart-related surgeries.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><b>Determining the Factors Affecting the Cost</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The factors determining the cost of heart valve replacement in India are broadly categorized into three types:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Hospital Factors</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Type of Hospital( Government/ trust/ Private)</span></li>

			<h2>Quality Assured Pocked Friendly Bentall’s Surgery in India</h2>
<p>Bentall surgery has reshaped the landscape of cardiac care. The cutting-edge technique, named after its visionary creator, Dr. Hugh Bentall, gives hope to patients with aortic aneurysms and valve problems. With extensive experience, advanced technology, and unwavering dedication, Bentall surgery empowers patients to live life to the fullest. Explore the transformative power of Bentall surgery, where every beat counts and every life is precious.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>This procedure involves the replacement of three things:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Aortic root (base of the aorta)<br>
● Aortic Valve<br>
● Aortic Ascending Segment (to ensure normal blood flow)</p>
<p>This gold-standard procedure has significantly improved the prognosis of patients suffering from aortic aneurysms and other related conditions. Let us explore this procedure in detail, including its indications, surgical technique, pre and post-operative care, and the best Indian surgeons performing this technique in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Indications</strong></span></p>
<p>Your doctor may recommend a Bentall procedure if you have problems with your aorta. The most common problems are:<br>
● Aortic Regurgitation<br>
● Aortic Aneurysm<br>
● Aortic Dissection<br>
● Marfan Syndrome</p>
<p><strong>Sometimes patients may develop other problems in their aorta for various reasons. This may be due to:</strong><br>
● Autoimmune diseases<br>
● Congenital heart problems<br>
● Infection<br>
● High blood pressure<br>
● Physical Trauma</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Diagnosis</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>For doctors to evaluate if you need a Bentall procedure, the following tests are required:</strong><br>
● Chest X-Ray<br>
● Transthoracic Echocardiography<br>
● CT scan<br>
● Cardiac MRI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Knowing Bentall Procedure in Detail</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Before the Surgery</strong><br>
● Before the surgery is planned, you will have to get clearance from the physician that you are in good condition for the surgery.<br>
● You will have to undergo tests like CBC, ECG, and other basic blood work.<br>
● You will have to decide with your surgeon if you want a mechanical valve replacement or a valve made of synthetic or biological material.<br>
● Check with your doctor about the medications you are taking. Some medications need to be stopped before the surgery.<br>
● Ensure your bowels are open, and ask for a laxative if required.<br>
● Make sure to stop eating or drinking before the surgery.</p>
<p><strong>During the Surgery</strong><br>
● Anesthesia: You will be under general anesthesia during the surgery. A chestline incision is made to access the heart and aorta.<br>
● Cardiopulmonary Bypass: You will be connected to a heart-lung machine temporarily performing the heart’s function.<br>
● Aortic Root Excision: The diseased aortic root is removed, and the aortic valve is removed.<br>
● Valve Replacement: Based on your decision, a mechanical or biological valve will be placed to restore proper blood flow.<br>
● Re-establishing Coronary Arteries: The coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, will be reattached to the graft to ensure proper oxygen supply.<br>
● Closing Incision: After ensuring proper heart function, the chest incision is closed.</p>
<p><strong>After the Surgery</strong></p>
<p>● After the procedure, you will stay in the ICU for three to four days.<br>
● You can sit out of bed two days after the surgery.<br>
● After four days in ICU, you will be shifted either in cardiac ward or in step down ICU for regaining daily activities.<br>
● This depends on hospital to hospital policies.</p>
<p><strong>During your stay in the cardiac ward, be aware of the following things:</strong></p>
<p>● Take care of your wound properly<br>
● You can become constipated. Make sure you eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.<br>
● You will feel tightness in the chest and pain in the incision site. Take your painkillers at a time.<br>
● You can have a fever, palpitations and anaemia (Due to blood loss) after the surgery. These symptoms will settle down in 4 – 8 weeks after the surgery.<br>
● It will take 6 to 8 days to regain mobility.<br>
● You will be discharged from the hospital after eight day of the surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Coping with Recovery</strong></p>
<p>● Bentall Surgery is a major surgery. Give yourself time to recover.<br>
● You may also consult cardiac rehabilitation to get yourself moving.<br>
● Your dressing will be changed twice in a week<br>
● Your stitches will be removed on 14th day of the surgery in case your wound is healed properly.</p>
<p><strong>Long term Care</strong></p>
<p>● If you have high blood pressure, take your medicines on time after the surgery.<br>
● Quit smoking and drinking<br>
● If you have had a mechanical valve replacement, you must take anti-coagulation medicines your entire life.<br>
● You will need three months iron and folic acid to counter your anaemia<br>
● You will be needing chest belt for three months if you had sterniotomy done.<br>
● You are not allowed to bend forward untill three months<br>
● You are not allowed to lift the weight<br>
● You are not allowed to eat green leafy vegetables in case you are on anti-coagulant medicines, this may lead to bleeding</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is a Synthetic Graft?</strong></span></p>
<p>Bentall surgery uses synthetic grafts, which are man-made tubes typically made of polyester or Dacron. Basically, it replaces the aortic root, which is the base of the aorta, if it’s damaged. The surgeon removes the damaged aorta and replaces it with a synthetic graft. Grafts are carefully sutured to healthy aorta segments and connected to the heart, so blood flows through the aortic valve and into the graft, bypassing the weakened area. It restores normal blood flow to the heart and keeps the aneurysm from expanding or rupturing. Aortic aneurysms and issues with the aortic valve can be treated with synthetic grafts in Bentall surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits of Bentall Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● Bentall surgery is a life-saving procedure for patients with aortic aneurysms.<br>
● It prevents recurrent aneurysms.<br>
● It can significantly improve a patient’s quality of life.<br>
● It improves overall cardiovascular function by restoring normal blood flow.<br>
● It includes aortic valve replacement, which addresses problems like severe aortic valve regurgitation.<br>
● Using high-quality synthetic grafts and mechanical or biological valves provides long-term durability.<br>
● By repairing the weakened aortic wall, Bentall surgery reduces the risk of aortic dissection, a life-threatening condition where a tear occurs in the aortic wall.<br>
● With advancements in surgical techniques and post-operative care, the Bentall procedure has excellent survival rates.</p>

<p>Erectile dysfunction affects one in two men who are over 50 years of age. ED involves having trouble in getting an erection or maintains penal firmness during sexual intercourse.</p>
<p><strong>What causes Erectile Dysfunction?</strong></p>
<p>It could be caused due to psychological factors or underlying diseases such as diabetes, prostate surgery, heart diseases, smoking &amp; alcohol, etc.</p>
<p><strong>What are the symptoms of Erectile Dysfunction?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Duration of erection is not long enough to perform a sexual intercourse</li>
<li>Erection does not happen when desired</li>
<li>Erection does not happen at all</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When should one seek a medical assistance?</strong></p>
<p>When ED starts affecting the person’s sexual relationship and mental well-being.</p>
<p><strong>What are the ED-related treatment options available?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Lifestyle changes to improve heart and blood circulation</li>
<li>Treatment of one’s emotional health</li>
<li>Oral medication includes sildenafil or tadalafil pills increases penile blood flow resulting in a strong erection in 7 out of 10 men.</li>
<li><strong>Surgical treatment:</strong> A penile implant or penile prosthesis is a surgical treatment option available for men when conservative treatment didn’t work well. Despite being the most invasive form of medical treatment, penile implant surgery provides an advantage that helps achieving natural and high sexual satisfaction in most men.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What is a penile implant?</strong></p>
<p>Surgery is needed when conservative treatment didnt work.&nbsp; Penile implant is mainly of two types: (a) bendable or semi-rigid and (b) inflatable. Bendable penile implants are best suitable for patients with spinal cord injury or limited hand strength. A pair of bendable rods is surgically positioned inside the erectile chambers of the penis. This makes the penis remain in a semi-rigid position and doesn’t require the initiation of erection before sexual intercourse. However, inflatable or hydraulic penile implants are preferred by most men. The device comes in two and three pieces.</p>
<p><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of the different types of penile implants?</strong></p>

<p><strong>What happens during the penile implant surgery?</strong></p>
<p>The three-piece penile implant has two cylindrical rods, one reservoir and one pump. The surgery can be carried out during spinal or general anesthesia based on patient’s age and medical condition. Surgeon makes three incisions first at the base of patient’s penis for two reasons: (1) to reach out to the two hollow muscular chambers, known as ‘erectile chambers’, and (2) for placing the customized cylindrical rods which is connected to the reservoir through tubes. Second and third incisions are made for positioning the pump and the reservoir inside the scrotal sac and lower abdomen respectively. Hydraulic pump is also attached with a separate reservoir. Surgery takes about an hour to complete. Surgeon then locks the incisions with the stitches. In case of two-pieces device, the reservoir fits inside the scrotum along with the pump.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>How are inflatable / hydraulic penile implants used?</strong></p>
<p>During sexual intercourse, patient must press the pump which releases saline water from the reservoir into the cylinders, resulting in an inflation that leads to erection. Once sex is over, patient has to press the deflating valve, which transfers saline water back to the reservoir. Thereafter, the penis returns to its normal flaccid position due to the deflation of cylinders.</p>
<p><strong>What happens after erectile dysfunction treatment?</strong></p>
<p>The patient will have to remain under observation in the hospital for one day after the surgery, during which they will be given antibiotics and painkillers. The penis of the patient is tied on their abdomen, pointing towards their umbilicus or bellybutton, to prevent downward curvature during the healing stage.</p>
<p><strong>What are the common complications associated with penile implant surgery? </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Commonest is Infection however it can be reduced by giving antibiotics.</li>
<li>Uncommon is failure or malfunctioning of implant which calls for its repair or replacement.</li>
<li>In extreme conditions, the implant can come out if the penile skin gets ruptured.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is the sexual experience with having the penal implant inside of the body?</strong></p>
<p>Once erection is achieved, it would feel normal as before. Implants don’t interfere with the sexual feelings, level of satisfaction, ability to have an orgasm, ejaculation and timings of ejaculation. The only difference is that the implants don’t make the penile head hard as before.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a training to understand the proper functioning of a penile implant?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, after surgery you would need to stay for a week in India to learn how to inflate and deflate the penile implant.</p>
<p><strong>Do penile implants cause a decrease in the length of the penis?</strong></p>
<p>Your penile implant will be customized according to the size of the penis. Implants neither increases nor decreases the size of the penis.</p>
<p><strong>Does penile prosthesis result in natural erections?</strong></p>
<p>Penile prosthesis gives control over erection and one can have an erection at any time they desire. However, natural or spontaneous erection is not device dependent.</p>
<p><strong>Will my partner notice that I have a penile prosthesis?</strong></p>
<p>Noticing a surgical scar at the bottom of the penis is the only way you partner may get to know about the penile prosthesis. The implant is placed inside the penis and looks natural in flaccid position. Semi-rigid implants may sometimes appear through clothing.</p>
<p><strong>How long do patients take to recover after surgery?</strong></p>
<p>Normal recovery period is 4-6 weeks. Follow the instructions given by your physician during this phase for best outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Can I do an MRI if I have a penile implant?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this prosthesis is MRI compatible.</p>
<p><strong>Do these implants have a shelf life? How frequently do these implants need to be changed?</strong></p>
<p>The implants may last for up to 10-15 years if used twice a week. Reports suggest that patients have functional implants that lasted for as long as 20 years. It should be noted, however, that since implants are a mechanical device after all, normal wear and tear is unavoidable, and its shelf life is subject to usage.</p>
<p><strong>After penile surgery, how much average increase in penile length can be achieved?</strong></p>
<p>After the surgery, the penis can increase by two inches in length and one inch in girth.</p>
<p><strong>What is success rate of erectile dysfunction treatment? </strong></p>
<p>Ninety percent of the men are highly satisfied with the erection and sexual experience after getting implants. Success rates of getting implants in India are at par with the world standards, however, it should be understood that every surgical procedure could have its own complications. Hence, cases with 4% mechanical failure rates could be corrected by a revision surgery.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>What is the </strong><strong>recommended frequency of usage after the implant?</strong></p>
<p>It is harmless if used two to three times a week without causing any kind of injury in blood vessels and penile tissues. However, if carefully tackled, patient can also use it daily for weeks or even months</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Penile Implant Surgery: Reclaiming Intimate Wellness</span></h2>
<p>Penile implants are the devices that are placed inside the penis of men who are suffering from erectile dysfunction. It helps them to achieve erection. It is the last resort for the men when no other treatment option works for them.</p>
<p>Here, we will examine the types of penile implants available and how they work. We will also take a look at how the surgery is performed in India and why it is best to get the surgery done in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is a penile implant?</strong></span></p>
<p>A penile implant is a device that helps men to achieve erection if they have erectile dysfunction. It is of three types:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>One-piece implants or semi-rigid implants</strong></span></p>
<p>One-piece implants use flexible or semi-rigid cylinders. This implant is rigid enough for sex and remains in an erect position always. Complete concealment is not possible via clothes, as there will always be some degree of visibility.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits:</strong></span> least expensive type of implant, fewer mechanical parts to fail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Downsides:</strong></span> least natural erection, no antibiotic coating; worst rigidity; worst flaccidity</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Good for:</strong> </span>men with poor hand function or men with a buried penis who need a prosthetic to hold on a condom-style catheter</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Two-piece Implants or Inflatable penile implant</strong></span></p>
<p>Two-piece cylinders are made of cylinders and a pump. The pump is hidden in your scrotum. Pumping fills the cylinders with fluid to give you an erection.</p>
<p>Bending your penis allows the fluid to move out of the cylinders, so your penis can become flaccid<br>
.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits:</strong></span> excellent rigidity; no need to place any parts in the pelvis or abdomen</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Downsides:</strong></span> no antibiotic coating; not good flaccidity; not good for very thin men; not good for larger penises due to poor flaccidity</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Good for:</strong></span> men who have extremely complex pelvic issues that make placement of a three-piece penile implant less desirable, such as men who have had certain pelvic crush injuries or those with complex vascular reconstruction – very few men fall into this category.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Three-Piece Penile Implant</strong></span></p>
<p>Three-piece implants are the most commonly used devices. They consist of a pair of cylinders in the penis, a pump placed inside your scrotum near your testicles, and a reservoir of saline. Squeezing the pump in your scrotum moves the saline into the cylinders, creating a rigid erection that feels natural.<br>
Inflatable penile Implant remains inflated as long as you desire. When you’re ready, you’ll hit a deflate button on the pump that returns the penis to a flaccid, soft state.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits:</strong></span> excellent rigidity and flaccidity; total control over the erection; antibiotic coatings are available</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Downsides:</strong></span> need for placement of reservoir in your pelvis/abdomen, mechanical failure of the penile implant</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Good for:</strong></span> most men with erectile problems, including those from prostate cancer, diabetes, vascular disease, spinal cord injury, pelvic trauma, transplant patients, and others</p>
<p>New penile Implant Devices</p>
<p>Several new penile implant devices have been introduced to the market. Some of them are listed below:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>AMS TACTRA</strong></span></p>
<p>It is a semi rigid penile implant that Boston Scientific creates. It is a simple implant that is made to create a long-lasting and tough erection. It has a dual silicone construction with nitinol in the center. The design enables men to have flexibility during sexual activity and drive their penis down when not in use.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>RIGICON INFLA 10 X</strong></span></p>
<p>It is a three piece inflatable penile implant that Rigicon creates. It is easy to apply and is best for sexual intercourse. It has a polyurethane coating and dual-layer silicone construction, which provides your penis strength and sturdiness. It has a touch valve that allows it to deflate the equipment when required quickly. It is available in a range of lengths and sizes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>COLOPLAST TITAN TOUCH</strong></span></p>
<p>The Titan Penile Implant is a three piece gadget present since 2014. It has a one-touch pump that allows it to inflate and deflate the apparatus easily. It also has a lockout valve to stop auto inflation. It is one of the best penile implant devices and is available in different lengths and sizes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>AMS 700 LGX PENILE IMPLANT</strong></span></p>
<p>It is an inflated three-piece implant developed by Boston Scientific. Silicone and polyurethane provide flexibility and durability to it. The device has a brief squeeze pump that makes it easy for the affected person to inflate and deflate it. In addition, it has an antibiotic layer of InhibiZone that lowers the danger of contamination. A type of versions of the AMS 700 are presented, such as the AMS 700 LGX (length and girth growth), CX (managed enlargement), CXR (controlled enlargement for constrained anatomies), and MS (temporary squeezing).</p>
<p>These implants offer various capacities and advantages for ED sufferers searching for a surgical remedy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Penile Implant Size options</strong></span></p>
<p>The size of the penile implant is crucial for the one who is undergoing the surgery. You will be offered multiple sizes of implants to choose from. The main aim of the customization is to increase overall satisfaction and offer a natural appearance to the penis after the surgery. You can choose the size of the implant based on your comfort level.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Inflatable Implants:</strong></span> They come in different cylinder lengths to accommodate the size of the penis.</p>
<p>Semi Rigid or Malleable Implant: they come in the form of bendable rods, and the size of the rod can be adjusted according to the size of your penis.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How does a penile implant work?</strong></span></p>
<p>An inflatable penile implant has two cylinders, a reservoir, and a pump surgically placed into your body.<br>
The surgeon will insert cylinders into your penis. Tubes connect the cylinders to a separate reservoir under your lower abdominal (stomach) muscles. The reservoir contains fluid. A penile implant pump also connects to this system. It is placed under the loose skin of your scrotum, between your testicles.</p>
<p>To inflate the implant, you have to press the pump in your scrotum. Pressing the pump doesn’t put any pressure on your testicles. The pump transfers fluid from the reservoir to the cylinders in your penis, inflating them to the level of hardness that you want. Once erect, you can maintain your erection for as long as you wish, even after an orgasm. When you want to stop the erection, pressing a valve on the pump returns the fluid to the reservoir, which brings your penis back to its original shape.</p>
<p>A semi-rigid penile implant has two firm, flexible silicone rods. This type of device doesn’t require pumping. It has bendable rods that are implanted inside the penis. The rods remain in the semi-erect state and the users manually position the penis for sexual activity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is a good candidate for a penile implant?</strong></span></p>
<p>● Men suffering from erectile dysfunction<br>
● Component of gender affirmation surgery<br>
● Treatment of severe cases of scarring inside the penis</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>You are not a good candidate for penile implant if:</strong></span></p>
<p>● You have an infection like a pulmonary or urinary tract infection<br>
● Diabetes<br>
● Cardiovascular disease</p>
<p>Understanding penile implant surgery in detail</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What happens before the penile implant surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● If you choose to get the surgery in India, your healthcare provider will perform a physical examination and review your medical history.<br>
● The physical exam involves a urologic exam. It includes examining your genitals, prostate, and urine samples.<br>
● All treatment options will be considered before going ahead with a penile implant. Most doctors in India recommend surgery only when all other treatment options fail to treat ED.<br>
● Discuss the pros and cons of the surgery with the doctor beforehand.<br>
● Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking any medications or herbal supplements.<br>
● Tell your doctor if you have any allergies.<br>
● The healthcare provider will also give you specific instructions on eating and drinking before your penis implant.<br>
● It would help if you didn’t eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery. If you must take medications, you should take them with a small sip of water.<br>
● You do not need to shave the pubic hair before the surgery. Your doctor will do it before the surgery.<br>
● Always make sure that you do not have any active infection before the surgery. If you have, you will have to notify your doctor.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The surgery is performed using spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia.<br>
● Prior to the surgery, the pubic hair is shaved. A catheter is placed to collect urine, and an IV is placed to inject antibiotics.<br>
● The surgeon will make an incision in the lower abdomen, the base of your penis, or just below the head of your penis.<br>
● The two inflatable cylinders are placed inside the penis. The size of the implants will depend on your body measurements.<br>
● If your surgeon is implanting a two-piece inflatable device, then a pump and valve are also placed inside the scrotum.<br>
● For a three-piece penile implant, a pump goes into your scrotum, and the reservoir is inserted under your abdominal wall.<br>
● Finally, the surgeon will close the incisions.<br>
● The procedure is done on an outpatient basis and takes 45 to 90 minutes to complete.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>After the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● After the penile implant surgery, you will be moved to the recovery room.<br>
● Once you are fully awake, after the effect of anesthesia, you may feel soreness in your groin and abdominal area.<br>
● Your pain will be treated using pain management drugs.<br>
● In most cases, you can go home a few hours after the implant.<br>
● Please make sure to have a family member beside you to help take care of you after the implant.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is recovery like?</strong></span></p>
<p>● After the surgery, you will need medications to relieve the pain.<br>
● A long-acting injection is given into the scrotum to reduce pain for 48 to 72 hours.<br>
● Ask your healthcare provider about when you can resume your daily activities.<br>
● Most men resume daily physical activities after 4 to 6 weeks.<br>
● You will be able to resume sexual activity six weeks after the surgery.<br>
● Your doctor will give you instructions on how to use the pump.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Are penile implants effective?</strong></span></p>
<p>Although penile implants are the most invasive treatment for erectile dysfunction, most men who have them and their partners report satisfaction with the devices. In fact, penile implants have the highest rate of satisfaction of all erectile dysfunction treatments. Thus, if we talk about penile implants before and after, then we can only say that men have reported 100 % satisfaction after this surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Benefits of the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>● The main benefit of the implant is that it helps you maintain an erection that is firm enough for the sex.<br>
● The procedure is safe and has a low risk of complications<br>
● The results of the procedure are satisfying. Over 90 percent of people are happy with the results.<br>
● Penile implants are durable. They last for about 20 years.<br>
● Increased self-esteem</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Risks of the surgery</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The penile implant complaints are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● After the penile implant surgery, the risk of infection is possible<br>
● New penile implants are reliable, but in some cases, there may be malfunction.<br>
● In some cases, the implant might stick to the skin inside the penis, and it can also break through the skin.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When to see the doctor?</strong></span></p>
<p>● Heavy bleeding in the incision area<br>
● A fever of 100 degrees Celsius or higher<br>
● Increased pain<br>
● Infection at the surgical site</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How common are penile implants?</strong></span></p>
<p>Penile implants are becoming more common these days. About 63000 procedures have been performed in India since the last decade.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How long do penile implants last?</strong></span></p>
<p>On average, a penile implant lasts for 20 years. When the average age of a penile implant passes, it stops working. Your surgeon can re-do the surgery by replacing it with a new implant.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How big can a penile implant be?</strong></span></p>
<p>In most of the cases, the look and the size of the erection after the implant are comparable to the size of the penis before the surgery. Your surgeon will always measure the inside of your penis and place the biggest implant that is safe to put in your body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Can you get hard with the implant?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, a penile implant allows one to get an erection whenever required. It can take a couple of minutes to pump the inflatable penile implant to obtain full rigidity.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Does the penile implant feel the same?</strong></span></p>
<p>When you inflate your penis, the prosthetic penile implant makes your penis stiff and thick, like a natural erection. Most people with a penile implant report that sex feels the same or better than before the procedure. It won’t change the sensation on the skin of your penis. A penile implant also doesn’t affect your ability to ejaculate and orgasm. It may take you a few weeks or even a couple of months to adjust to the sensation of having an implant. However, many people who get penile implants report high satisfaction once they fully heal.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Can a woman tell if a man has a penile implant?</strong></span></p>
<p>In most cases, women cannot tell if a man has a penile implant because the implants are concealed. However, it is important to remain true to your partner about it.</p>
<p>Women’s Complaints about penile implant</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The most common complaints of women related to penile implants are:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Mild pain during sex<br>
● Penile implants have less flexibility</p>
<p>We suggest having an open dialogue with your partner about the expectations and seeking professional guidance to have a smooth experience with implant surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>How is life after penile implant surgery?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Life after penile implant surgery includes:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Restored confidence<br>
● Good sexual relationship<br>
● Positive impact on the overall life of an individual.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Can a man with a penile implant get a woman pregnant?</strong></span></p>
<p>A man with a penile implant can make a woman pregnant, but fertility depends on several factors. Please speak to your surgeon or healthcare provider about it.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Transgender penile implant</strong></span></p>

<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is IVF?</span></h2>
<p>In vitro fertilisation, or IVF, is a type of fertility treatment in which sperm and eggs are mixed together outside of the body in a laboratory. It’s a technique utilized by those who require assistance getting pregnant. IVF is a successful type of assisted reproductive technology that entails numerous difficult steps (ART) explains Dr Ila Gupta , Clinical Director at Ferticity Fertility Clinic, New Delhi.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">The Procedure</span></h2>
<p>A type of assisted reproductive technology (ART) known as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) involves the fertilisation of sperm and eggs outside of the human body. IVF is a challenging procedure that requires taking eggs out of the ovaries and manually mixing sperm and eggs in a lab to fertilise the eggs. The fertilised egg, which is now known as an embryo, is implanted inside a uterus a few days after fertilisation. When this embryo embeds itself in the uterine wall, pregnancy results.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Why is IVF performed?</span></h2>
<p>People choose IVF for a variety of reasons, such as infertility problems or when one partner has a pre-existing medical condition. Some people will try IVF if other fertility treatments haven’t worked for them or if they’re past the prime of pregnancy. IVF is an option if you or your partner has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low sperm count or other sperm impairments.</li>
<li>Polycystic ovary syndrome or other ovarian conditions.</li>
<li>Blocked or damaged fallopian tubes.</li>
<li>Uterine fibroids.</li>
<li>Problems with your uterus.</li>
<li>Risk of passing on a genetic disease or disorder.</li>
<li>Unexplained infertility.</li>
<li>Are using an egg donor or a gestational surrogate.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">What are the steps of IVF treatment?</span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Birth control pills or estrogen:</strong> Your IVF specialist might recommend oestrogen or birth control before you begin IVF treatment. This is used to regulate the timing of your menstrual cycle and prevent the growth of ovarian cysts. It enables your IVF specialist to manage your care and increase the quantity of mature eggs throughout the egg retrieval process. While some people are prescribed birth control pills that include both oestrogen and progesterone, others only receive oestrogen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Ovarian stimulation:</strong> An egg batch starts to grow each month during a healthy person’s natural cycle who is of reproductive age. Usually, only one egg develops to the point where it can ovulate. The remaining eggs in that group that are still immature shattered. You will administer injectable hormone drugs throughout your IVF cycle to encourage the batch of eggs to mature all at once and fully. This indicates that you might have numerous eggs instead of just one (as in a natural cycle). Your medical history, age, AMH (anti-mullerian hormone) level, and reaction to ovarian stimulation during prior IVF cycles will all be taken into account when determining the type, dosage, and frequency of medications that will be prescribed for you specifically.</p>
<p><em>The other steps in the ovarian stimulation process include:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong> – Ultrasounds and blood hormone levels are used to monitor how your ovaries are responding to the drugs. Over a two-week period, monitoring can take place everyday or every few days. Most stimulations endure for eight to fourteen days.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger shot</strong> – A “trigger shot” is administered to complete the maturation of your eggs in order to prepare for egg retrieval when they are ready for final maturation, which is determined by your ultrasound and hormone levels.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Egg retrieval:</strong> A tiny needle is inserted into each of your ovaries through your vagina by your IVF specialist using an ultrasound as guidance. Your eggs are extracted from each follicle using suction equipment that is attached to the needle. You put your eggs in a dish with a unique solution. Next, the dish is placed in an incubator (controlled environment). For this treatment, light anaesthesia and medication are utilised to lessen discomfort. The “trigger shot,” your last hormone injection, is given 36 hours before egg retrieval.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 4:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Fertilization:</strong> The embryologist will attempt to fertilise all mature eggs using intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, the afternoon after your egg retrieval operation. This implies that each developed egg will get sperm injection. ICSI cannot be conducted on immature eggs. The undeveloped eggs will be put in a dish with sperm and food. Rarely do immature eggs complete their development in the dish. The sperm in the dish can then attempt to fertilise the egg if an immature</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 5:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Embryo development:</strong> Your embryos’ growth will be closely watched during the ensuing five to six days. Before it is ready to be transferred into your uterus, your embryo must clear many obstacles. 50% of fertilised embryos typically reach the blastocyst stage. The best time to transfer to your uterus is at this stage. Three or four of seven fertilised eggs, for instance, might progress to the blastocyst stage. Usually, 50% of the remaining candidates do not advance and are eliminated. On day five or day six after fertilisation, all viable embryos will be preserved in preparation for upcoming embryo transfers.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Step 6:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Embryo transfer:</strong> Fresh and frozen embryo transfers are the two different types of embryo transfers. Depending on your particular circumstances, your IVF specialist can help you determine if using fresh or frozen embryos is ideal for you. The identical transfer procedure is used for frozen and fresh embryo transfers. The name already makes the primary distinction clear.</p>
<p>A fresh embryo transfer occurs three to seven days following the egg retrieval operation, when the embryo is put into your uterus. This embryo is “fresh” because it hasn’t been frozen.</p>
<p>A frozen embryo transfer entails the thawing and implantation of frozen embryos (from an earlier IVF cycle or donor eggs) into your uterus. Due to practical considerations and the higher likelihood of a live birth, this approach is more widespread. Years after egg retrieval and fertilisation can pass before frozen embryo transfers take place.</p>
<p>There is no need for anesthesia during the simple embryo transfer procedure. It has a comparable sensation to a Pap smear or pelvic exam. A tiny catheter is introduced into the uterus through the cervix using a speculum positioned within the vagina. A syringe with one or more embryos inside it is connected to the catheter’s other end. Through the catheter, the embryos are inserted into the uterus. Usually, the process is finished in under ten minutes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Pregnancy</strong></span></p>
<p>When the embryo embeds itself in the uterine lining, pregnancy results. About nine to 14 days following embryo transfer, your doctor will perform a blood test to see if you’re pregnant. The same procedures are followed if donor eggs are being used.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Is an IVF baby normal?</span> </strong></p>
<p>In general, YES; there is not much difference in the anomaly rate of the babies born by IVF or naturally.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Can I have baby even when my testicular biopsy report says nil sperm count (Azoospermia)?</span> </strong></p>
<p>Yes; if testis are producing sperm, which due to obstruction are not coming out, causing nil sperm count then one can conceive by ICSI following testicular sperm extraction (Micro TESA). Whole procedure will cost you an additional 1650$.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Can I have IVF in case of tubal blockage?&nbsp;</span> </strong></p>
<p>IVF was started for such cases only so it makes a real indication for IVF.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Can we save our eggs or sperms or embryos for future use?&nbsp;</span> </strong></p>
<p>Yes; you can freeze them for future use. The cost of freezing is US$ 500 for one year.&nbsp; Your surplus embryos freezing will give you chances to conceive at a very low cost say 1000$.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is the most fertile period of a woman?</span> </strong></p>
<p>Women are most fertile two weeks before the next menstrual cycle. For example, a woman with 34 days menstrual cycle is likely to ovulate at 20 days. We recommend unprotected intercourse around that period starting at least four days before ovulation.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">How long does an IVF procedure take? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> </strong></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">How is ICSI different from IVF?</span> </strong></p>
<p>ICSI is intra cytoplasmic sperm injection in which a single healthy sperm is injected into each egg to enhance the chances of fertilization. Advanced microscopes with a needle is used to detect the sperm (with normal morphology) &amp; insert to the Egg to ensure normal fertilization.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">What is Pre Implantation Genetic Testing?&nbsp;</span> </strong></p>
<p>It is required for older women who have a higher chance of producing chromosomally abnormal baby, also done in cases of repeated IVF/ICSI failures, history of recurrent miscarriages, in cases of any parental genetic diseases etc.</p>
<p><strong>Assisted Hatching:</strong> It is carried out in case of two or more IVF failures, advanced age of woman and poor quality of embryos.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">From Wellness to Fatherhood: A Deep Dive into Male Fertility Treatment in India</span></h2>
<p>Infertility is primarily a disease of the reproductive system. It makes people unable to have children. It can affect both men and women. Male infertility is basically a problem in which men have problems with their reproductive system. It means men cannot get their female partners pregnant.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you are infertile, this article is for you, and we will give you knowledge about the best infertility treatments available in India. Many tests can detect fertility problems. Once the cause is found, it becomes easy to get the treatment, which may include medicines or surgery. Many couples treated for fertility are able to have babies now. This is only possible due to cutting-edge technology and the availability of skilled doctors in India. Let us talk about how you can avail fertility treatment in India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What happens under normal conditions?</strong></span></p>
<p>The man’s body makes tiny cells known as sperms. During sex, these sperm are released into a woman’s body. The male reproductive system makes, stores, and transports sperm. Hormones control this process.</p>
<p>The sperm and male hormones known as testosterone are made in the two testicles. When sperm leaves the testicles, it goes into a tube known as epididymis.</p>
<p>Just before ejaculation, the sperm goes into the vas deferens from the epididymis. During ejaculation, the sperm mixes with semen, and then it comes out of the penis.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.healthdirect.gov.au/male-reproductive-system">Male reproductive</a> health depends upon how normally your body makes sperm and releases it out of your body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Male Infertility Causes</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Obstructions</strong></span></p>
<p>As already told above, sperms are made in testicles. They spend 2 to 10 days from passing through the epididymis to the vas deferens (the long muscular tube that carries sperm from the testicles to the urethra). The vas deferns ejaculates the sperm, and after that, it mixes with semen.</p>
<p>During ejaculation, muscular contraction forces the semen into the urethra and then out of the penis. Blockage or absence of tubes ( vas deferns) can be a cause of male infertility. Blockages and absence may be congenital or due to any injury.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Sperm Disorders</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Another cause of male infertility may be due to sperm disorders. It can be due to:</strong></span></p>
<p>●<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> Azoospermia:</strong></span> the semen does not contain any sperm. It can be due to blockage or testicles not producing sperm.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Oligospermia:</strong></span> insufficient sperm count, which is not enough to bring about conception.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Abnormal shape:</strong></span> a healthy sperm is shaped like a tadpole. Abnormally shaped sperms do not fuse into women’s eggs.<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Poor Motility:</strong></span> a healthy sperm has a lashing tail, which allows it to swim in the womens reproductive system. Sperm with poor Motility cannot swim at all.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Functional Problems</strong></span></p>
<p>● Impotence is the inability to maintain an erection during sexual intercourse.<br>
● Premature ejaculation<br>
● Removal of the prostate gland<br>
● Disorders like multiple sclerosis or diabetes<br>
● When the immune system starts making antibodies that hinder the natural functioning of sperms.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Hormonal Problems</span></strong></p>
<p>The pituitary gland influences the production of male sex hormones known as testosterone under the influence of the hypothalamus. A relatively uncommon cause of male infertility may be the improper functioning of the pituitary gland.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Environment and lifestyle factors</span></strong></p>
<p>This includes the use of tobacco, heavy alcohol, marijuana, steroids, and exposure to toxins. These are the major male infertility causes.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Who is likely to deal with male infertility?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">The following people are at an increased risk of male infertility:</span></strong></p>
<p>● Pre-existing genetic condition<br>
● Use of alcohol and drugs<br>
● Severe mumps infection<br>
● Hernia repairs<br>
● Hormone disorder<br>
● Wearing tight underwear<br>
● Injury in the groin area<br>
● Retrograde ejaculation occurs when sperm is forced back into the bladder<br>
● Erectile dysfunction<br>
● History of STD<br>
● Urinary tract infection<br>
● Use of certain types of medication for treatment of anxiety, depression, high blood pressure, and cancer</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Symptoms</span></strong></p>
<p>The main symptom of male infertility is the inability to have a child. In some cases, an underlying disorder may also be a cause of male infertility. Please make sure to contact your healthcare provider if you experience the following symptoms:</p>
<p>● Problems with sexual function<br>
● Pain or lump in testicles<br>
● Inability to smell<br>
● Recurrent respiratory infections<br>
● Decreased facial hair<br>
● Low sperm count</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Male Fertility Tests</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tests to detect male infertility include: </strong></span><br>
● Semen analysis<br>
● Blood tests<br>
● Ultrasound of testicles and scrotum<br>
● Testicular biopsy<br>
● Hormonal test<br>
● Vasography<br>
● Genetic testing</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Can Male infertility be treated?</strong></span></p>
<p>Yes, male infertility can be treated depending on the underlying causes. Various treatment options to treat male infertility are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Lifestyle Changes:</strong></span> These include maintaining a balanced diet, regular exercise and avoiding alcohol.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Medications:</strong></span> It involves hormonal treatment to boost sperm production.<br>
Surgery: It involves various procedures like TESA and Micro TESE.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Counselling and Support:</strong></span> Dealing with infertility can be challenging. Counselling and support can help you navigate the emotional aspects of fertility issues.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Male Infertility Treatment Available in India</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There are various treatment options to treat male fertility in India. Let us understand them one by one:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Bloating of veins inside the testes, also known as varicocele, may impair male fertility. This condition can be treated via surgery.</p>
<p>The tubes in the male reproductive system that transports sperm can be blocked due to injury. These blockages can be surgically removed and repaired.</p>
<p>If surgery doesn’t work, the man may undergo a surgical procedure called percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration (PESA). Under local anesthetic, a slender needle is inserted into the epididymis. Sperms are removed and either used immediately for ICSI or frozen for later use.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hormone Therapy</strong></span></p>
<p>The pituitary gland in the brain is responsible for the release of a hormone known as gonadotropin. This hormone stimulates the production of sperm. In some cases, male infertility can be caused due to insufficient levels of gonadotropins. When you take these hormones as medicines, it can boost sperm production.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Artificial Insemination</strong></span></p>
<p>In this case, this means semen is collected, washed, and concentrated. It is then introduced into the female’s uterus through the cervix. This is a viable option when:</p>
<p>● The concentration of sperm is low in men’s semen<br>
● Man is impotent<br>
● Seminal fluid contains antibodies against sperm</p>
<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>IVF</strong></span></h2>
<p>In in vitro fertilization, the sperm from the man is collected and placed in a special incubator. The ovaries of women are stimulated with hormone injections, and when the eggs mature, they are taken out through an ultrasound-guided procedure.</p>
<p>The eggs are then mixed with sperm and placed in a special incubator. The eggs fertilise to develop an embryo, which is then implanted into a woman’s uterus through the cervix.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #0048ad;">Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection</span></strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, semen has very few sperms to make fertilization possible through IVF. ICSI injection can be used in such cases.</p>
<p>In ICSI, each egg is injected with a single sperm using a needle. The fertilized egg changes to the embryo and is then transferred into the female uterus at the right time.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>TESA</strong></span></p>
<p>It is a major male infertility treatment option. TESA known as Testicular Sperm Aspiration, is a procedure used to treat male infertility. It involves extracting sperm from testicles using a fine needle. TESA is often used when normal sperm retrieval becomes challenging. The collected sperm can then be used for in vitro fertilization to achieve pregnancy.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Micro TESE</strong></span></p>
<p>Micro TSE or Microsurgical Testicular Sperm Extraction, is a special procedure that is used to take sperm from testicles in case of severe infertility. It uses a high-powered microscope to identify and extract a small amount of testicular tissue that is highly likely to contain viable sperm. This technique is primarily used to treat men dealing with azoospermia, where sperm production gets impaired.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>PESA</strong></span></p>
<p>Percutaneous Epididymal Sperm Aspiration is a medical procedure used to collect sperm from the epididymis, a coiled tube where sperm matures and is stored. During this procedure, a fine needle is inserted into the epididymis to aspirate sperm. This procedure is used when the reproductive tract of a man is blocked, thus preventing sperm production.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>PICSI</strong></span></p>
<p>Physiological Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection is a technique that involves selecting sperms on their ability to bind to hyaluronic acid, a substance that is present in female eggs. This method aims at the natural sperm selection process and improves the chances of selecting high-quality sperm for fertilization.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prevention tips</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>There is nothing that can be done to treat male infertility that is caused by genetic disorders. However, here are some tips to prevent it:</strong></span></p>
<p>● Avoid having sex with unknown people to reduce the risk of STD<br>
● Avoid illegal drugs to maintain male reproductive health<br>
● Avoid radiation when possible<br>
● Avoid exposure to toxic substances<br>
● Avoid frequent use of alcohol<br>
● Observe good personal hygiene<br>
● Avoid long and hot baths<br>
● Wear loose-fitting underwear</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>Just because you have male infertility issues does not mean that you cannot have your child. There are many treatment options available in India. If you work with your partner and a urologist, you can increase the chances of conception.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #0048ad;">Female Infertility Treatment in India: From Despair to Hope</span></h2>
<p>Female infertility treatment is a common condition in which a female is unable to become pregnant or have a successful pregnancy. It is diagnosed when a woman tries to get pregnant for 12 months without a pregnancy. Infertility can result from female factors, male factors, or a combination of both. <a href="https://www.columbiadoctors.org/specialties/obstetrics-gynecology/our-services/columbia-university-fertility-center/our-services/conditions-and-treatments/female-infertility">Female factors cause infertility 33 percent of the time</a>. Characteristics can include ovulation dysfunction, anatomical problems, endometriosis, uterine defects, and immunological problems.</p>
<p>In this detailed article, we will discuss female infertility and why you should get its treatment from India.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What happens under normal conditions?</strong></span></p>
<p>New life begins when a sperm fertilizes an egg. Ovulation occurs when an egg is released from one of the ovaries, which happens 14 days before the start of menstrual period.<br>
The egg then goes to the fallopian tube and towards the uterus. If the egg gets fertilized, pregnancy begins.</p>
<p>The monthly chance of a young, fertile couple conceiving is approximately 25 %. If there is no pregnancy after 12 months of trying, then there may be a fertility issue.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Female Infertility Causes</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Ovulation problem</strong></span></p>
<p>● For ovulation to occur, the hypothalamus prompts the pituitary gland that triggers ovaries to release eggs.<br>
● Irregular or absent periods indicate that there are problems with ovulation.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Polycystic Ovary Syndrome</strong></span></p>
<p>PCOS is the most common hormonal condition affecting women in their reproductive years. Irregular periods are the main symptom of this condition.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Problem with fallopian tube</strong></span></p>
<p>The egg is fertilized in the fallopian tube. A blocked fallopian tube does not allow the egg to meet the sperm.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Problem with uterus</strong></span></p>
<p>The fertilized egg implants in the lining of the uterus. Certain conditions that do not allow implantation to happen are:</p>
<p>● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Fibroids:</strong></span> They are non-malignant tumors inside the womb<br>
● <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Polyps:</strong></span> They are small protrusions that grow in the uterus lining.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Problems with Cervix</strong></span></p>
<p>The entrance to the uterus is called the cervix. The ejaculated sperm must travel through the cervix to reach the fallopian tubes. During ovulation, the cervix mucus is thin, which allows the sperm to swim. However, when cervix mucus becomes thick, it can block the sperm.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Endometriosis</strong></span></p>
<p>It is a condition in which cells from the uterus lining migrate to the pelvis. It can damage the fallopian tube and affect the movement of egg and sperm.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Who is at risk?</strong></span></p>
<p>Many factors increase the risk of female infertility. General health conditions, inherited traits, lifestyle choices, and age can also contribute to female infertility.<br>
Specific factors include:<br>
● Age<br>
● Hormonal imbalance<br>
● Abnormal menstrual cycle<br>
● Obesity<br>
● Being underweight<br>
● Having a lot of body fat<br>
● Endometriosis<br>
● Cysts<br>
● Tumors<br>
● Autoimmune disorders<br>
● Sexually transmitted infections<br>
● PCOS<br>
● Excessive drinking<br>
● Smoking</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>What is the effect of age on female infertility?</strong></span></p>
<p>As a woman ages, her chances of becoming pregnant decrease. Generation is becoming a more common factor in female infertility because many couples wait till their 30s and 40s to have babies. Women who are above 35 years start facing fertility issues because:<br>
● The overall number of eggs is low<br>
● Eggs have abnormal chromosomes<br>
● Health conditions that develop after 35 years of age</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Tests for female infertility</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Female fertility tests include;</strong></span></p>
<p>● A physical examination<br>
● Blood test<br>
● Diagnostic Laparoscopy<br>
● Ultrasound scans<br>
● Ovulation Testing<br>
● Ovarian reserve testing</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Hormonal Assay For Female Infertility</strong></span></p>
<p>Hormonal assays play a crucial role in the assessment of female infertility. These tests help identify hormonal imbalances that may be contributing to fertility issues. Here are some standard hormonal assays performed for the evaluation of female infertility:<br>
Follicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH): Elevated FSH levels may indicate diminished ovarian reserve<br>
Luteinizing Hormone (LH): Abnormal levels of LH can affect the timing and regularity of ovulation.<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Estradiol:</strong> </span>Elevated or low levels of estradiol can indicate problems with ovarian function<br>
<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Progesterone:</strong></span> Low progesterone levels can result in implantation failure.<br>
Anti-Mullerian Hormone<span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong> (AMH)</strong></span>: Low AMH levels may suggest diminished ovarian reserve.<br>
Thyroid Function Tests <span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>(TSH, Free T4, Free T3)</strong></span>: Thyroid hormones regulate the menstrual cycle. Abnormal thyroid function affects fertility.<br>
Prolactin: Elevated prolactin levels, a hormone responsible for milk production, can interfere with ovulation.<br>
Testosterone: Testosterone is a male sex hormone that is also in smaller amounts in females. Imbalances in testosterone levels can affect ovarian function.</p>
<p>Insulin and Glucose: Insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose metabolism may be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common cause of female infertility.<br>
17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP): Elevated levels of 17-OHP may be associated with conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which can affect fertility.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Female Infertility Treatment Available in India</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>The treatment for female infertility in India depends upon the following factors: </strong></span><br>
● Age<br>
● Period of infertility<br>
● Personal preferences</h3>
<p>Female infertility treatments available in India either attempt to restore fertility through medication or help you get pregnant via sophisticated techniques.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Option 1: Medications</strong></span></p>
<p>Medications that regulate ovulation are known as fertility drugs. They are the primary treatment option for women who are infertile due to ovulation disorders. Fertility drugs work like natural hormones like FSH and LH to trigger ovulation. They are also used to improve the quality of the eggs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Option 2 Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>Any obstruction in female reproductive organs can cause female infertility as a result of uterine fibroids, polyps, or tubal blockages. These conditions can be addressed via laparoscopic surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Option 3:</strong></span> Assisted Reproductive Techniques</p>
<p>These techniques involve retrieving eggs from ovaries and handling eggs and sperm in a laboratory. ART involves hormone stimulation to make ovaries produce several eggs rather than one that matures every month. When the eggs are ready, they are retrieved using an ultrasound-guided procedure. It includes the following technologies:</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Intrauterine Insemination (IUI)</strong></span></p>
<p>Known as Intrauterine Insemination, it may be combined with ovulation. IUI is a technology in which washed sperm is deposited via a syringe into the uterus and fallopian tubes, where fertilization occurs.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)</strong></span></p>
<p>In this technique, your doctor will place embryos into your uterus that were fertilized outside in the lab. The doctor will prescribe gonadotropins that trigger the development of more than one egg. When the eggs mature, your doctor will take them out using an ultrasound-guided procedure.</p>
<p>Sperms are collected, washed, and added to the dish with eggs. Several days later, when eggs get fertilized sperm, they are put in the female uterus with a device known as an intrauterine insemination catheter.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI)</strong></span></p>
<p>Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) is a highly specialized assisted reproductive technology that has revolutionized the landscape of female infertility treatments. It is an advanced procedure that is used when IVF is unable to overcome fertility challenges.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Let’s delve into the intricacies of this procedure.</strong></span></p>
<p>Ovulation Stimulation: The process begins by giving hormone injections to stimulate the production of eggs in the woman’s ovaries.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Egg Retrieval:</strong></span> Once the eggs are mature, a minor surgical procedure called egg retrieval is performed under anesthesia.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Sperm Collection:</strong></span> Simultaneously, sperm samples are collected, either from the male partner or a sperm donor.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Microinjection:</strong></span> A single, high-quality sperm is selected and directly injected into the cytoplasm of a mature egg using a specialized micropipette.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Culturing Embryos:</strong></span> Following the microinjection, the fertilized eggs (now embryos) are cultured for a few days under controlled laboratory conditions.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Embryo Transfer:</strong></span> Once the embryos reach an optimal stage of development, one or more are carefully selected and transferred into the woman’s uterus</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>When is ICSI performed?</strong></span></p>
<p>ICSI is particularly recommended in cases where traditional fertilization methods may be compromised</p>
<p>● ICSI is often chosen when male partners have low sperm count or sperm are non-motile.<br>
● Previous IVF Failure<br>
● Unexplained Infertility:<br>
● Advanced Maternal Age:<br>
● Bad reproductive health in women</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Gamete Intrafallopian Tube Transfer(GIFT)</strong></span></p>
<p>GIFT stands for gamete intrafallopian tube transfer. The procedure involves retrieving an egg and combining it with a sperm in the lab. It is then inserted into the female fallopian tube.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>ZygoteI Intrafallopian Transfer (ZIFT)</strong></span></p>
<p>ZIFT stands for zygote intrafallopian transfer. In this procedure, the doctor will place zygotes in your fallopian tubes within 24 hours after fertilizing outside the body.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Option 4:</strong> </span>Egg Donation</p>
<p>This can help you if you are unable to get pregnant because you have a problem with your ovaries or the quality of eggs produced by your ovaries is not good. It involves removing eggs from the ovary of the donor, and after IVF, the fertilization will be transferred into your uterus.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Egg Freezing and Fertility Preservation</strong></span></p>
<p>When women face medical treatments like chemotherapy or radiation that might affect their fertility, they can choose to freeze their eggs. This means the eggs are stored for later use. It’s like hitting pause on the biological clock. This option gives women a chance to have children in the future, even if medical treatments impact their fertility.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Role of Lifestyle Factors in Female Fertility</strong></span></h3>
<p>What you eat, how much you exercise, and how you manage stress can affect your ability to have a baby. Eating a healthy diet, staying active, and finding ways to relax can positively impact your reproductive health. On the flip side, poor lifestyle choices can sometimes make it harder to get pregnant.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Role of Zinc and Folic Acid for female infertility</strong></span></h3>
<p>Zinc and folic acid play essential roles in female infertility treatment.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Zinc</strong></span></p>
<p>● Improves ovarian function<br>
● Aids fertilization<br>
● Regulates hormones and menstrual cycle</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Folic Acid</strong></span><br>
● Helps in fetal development<br>
● Improves fertility</p>
<h3><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Affordability and Accessibility of Fertility Treatments in India</strong></span></h3>
<p>Getting fertility treatments can be costly, and it’s essential to know what you’re getting into. In India, some places might be more affordable, and support and resources might be available. Accessibility is about ensuring these treatments are open to everyone, regardless of where they live or how much money they have. It’s about fairness and making family-building options accessible to many people.</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Preventing Female Infertility</strong></span></p>
<p>For women thinking of getting pregnant soon, these tips will help you stay fertile:<br>
● Maintain healthy weight<br>
● Quit smoking<br>
● Avoid Alcohol<br>
● Reduce Stress</p>
<p><span style="color: #0048ad;"><strong>Prognosis</strong></span></p>
<p>Just because you have female infertility issues does not mean that you cannot have your child. There are many treatment options available in India. If you work with your partner and an experienced gynecologist, you can increase the chances of conception.</p>
