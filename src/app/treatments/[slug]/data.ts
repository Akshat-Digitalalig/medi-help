			<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy Surgery in India-A complete Patient’s guide</span></h2>
<p>Thyroid cancer has become extremely common these days. With the increase in the number of cases and advancement in medical science, new surgical techniques have been developed for the treatment of cancer. People suffering from benign thyroid tumours and thyroid cancer can now take a sigh of relief with the development of <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy Sugery in India</strong>.</p>
<p>Robotic Thyroidectomy is a special surgical procedure where surgery is performed with the help of a robot. The robot receives the instructions from the surgeon and then puts them into action. The surgery has proved to be a boon for cancer patients who do not want any visible scar in the neck region after the surgery. In the robotic procedure, there are no visible scars because the thyroid region is accessed using an underarm incision. The results of <strong>robotic thyroidectomy surgery in Delhi</strong> are more aesthetically pleasing than conventional thyroid surgery.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What are the surgical treatment options available for thyroid cancer in India?</strong></span></h2>
<p>Surgery is the removal of the tumour surrounding the healthy tissue. It is the main treatment for people suffering from thyroid cancer. An oncologist decides the type of surgical option that would best suit the patient depending on the size and stage of the thyroid nodule. The common surgical options are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Lobectomy:</strong></span> In this surgery, a lobe of the thyroid gland is removed that has a cancerous nodule inside.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Near Total Thyroidectomy:</strong> </span>It is also called subtotal thyroidectomy in which most of the thyroid gland is removed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Total Thyroidectomy:</strong></span> This surgery involves the removal of the entire thyroid gland.</p>
<p>Different surgical approaches used for <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy in India</strong></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The different surgical techniques used in India are:</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Traditional Thyroidectomy:</strong></span> It is a standard technique in which the surgeon cuts through the middle of the base of the neck. The cut gives access to the thyroid gland from where the surgeon removed the cancerous nodules.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Endoscopic Thyroidectomy:</strong></span> The surgery is quite similar to conventional thyroidectomy except for a scope with a video monitor inserted to give a clear magnification of the thyroid gland. In this surgery, the surgeon makes a single small incision.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Robotic Thyroidectomy:</strong> </span>It is the most effective surgical technique performed in India to treat thyroid cancers. In this, the incision is made in the armpit, or behind the ear or through orally to access the thyroid gland. The surgeon then uses a robot to perform the surgery. However, the robot operates on the commands of the surgeon. This is the most widely used surgical technique these days as it involves no scarring and gives the best results.</p>
<p>The best surgical option and technique will be decided by your surgeon depending on the type of cancer you have. It is better to learn about the results and recovery time for each procedure before the surgery to select the best possible treatment option for yourself. Robotic Thyroidectomy is the latest technology that has brought exceptional results in the field of cancer treatment. If you want no scarring after the surgery and want minimum recovery time, it is just the right procedure for you. Continue reading to know more about it.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Where is Robotic Thyroidectomy needed?</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy in India</strong> may be recommended to patients who suffer from various thyroid diseases that require the removal of the thyroid gland. These diseases include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Benign Thyroid Nodules:</strong></span> These nodules are non-cancerous, However, their removal is necessary because they cause difficulty in swallowing and breathing.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Papillary Thyroid Cancer:</strong> </span>This is the most common type of thyroid cancer. It requires surgical removal of the thyroid tissue.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Follicular Thyroid Cancer:</strong></span> This type of thyroid cancer is comparatively less common as compared to papillary cancer, but its treatment also involves the removal of the thyroid gland.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Multinodular goiter:</strong></span> It is a condition in which the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and develops multiple nodules. Its surgery also requires the removal of thyroid tissue</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Hurthle cell Carcinoma:</strong></span> It is the most aggressive form of thyroid cancer which involves the removal of the entire thyroid gland.</p>
<p>Robotic <strong>Thyroidectomy surgery in India</strong> adds a new dimension to thyroid surgery which gives patients an option to have a scarless cancer surgery. Besides it, the use of robots allows surgeons to have a detailed look at the thyroid which enables them to perform the surgery with dexterity.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The latest treatment for Scarless Thyroidectomy in India:</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Types of robotic Thyroidectomy</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>RABIT:</strong></span> RABIT stands for Robotic-assisted breast-axilla insufflation thyroidectomy. It is a novel thyroid removal procedure invented by Dr Sandeep Nayak, a renowned oncologist in India. It is a more refined form of <strong>robotic thyroidectomy surgery in Delhi,</strong> which uses sophisticated Da Vinci Robotic devices to keep the wound small. It uses a single docking technique which enables the doctors to access both the lymph nodes and lobes when required. In this technique, the scar is hardly noticeable, as it is only 0.8 to 2 cm long, unlike conventional procedures that leave a visible 7 to 10 cm long scar in the neck region which ultimately deteriorates the confidence of the patients. Above all, this procedure is less complicated than traditional surgical methods.</p>
<p>TORS: TORS stands for Transoral Robotic Surgery. It is an effective option for people dealing with early oropharyngeal cancers. The main advantages of<strong> transoral robotic thyroidectomy</strong> include easy visualisation of the thyroid gland, superior manoeuvrability, safe dissections around the vital organs and it also enabled the patients to regain their normal functions quite quickly In this procedure, a small and flexible endoscope is inserted into the mouth and then into the throat. The surgeon then uses the robotic arms to perform precise surgical movements. It is a minimally invasive technique that involves less blood loss, reduced pain and faster recovery.</p>
<p>Retroauricular approach: It is also a minimally invasive approach in which the incision is made behind the ear to remove the thyroid gland. It is a safe and effective approach as compared to other traditional surgeries. With smaller incisions and less tissue trauma, patients can recover faster and have reduced pain, allowing them to go back to work faster. Some patients aren’t good candidates for this approach, so it’s best to consult with a qualified surgeon before deciding whether to proceed or not.</p>
<p>Unleashing the power of Robotics-A step by step guide for <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy Surgery In India</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Before surgery:</strong></span> Before undergoing robotic thyroidectomy, your healthcare provider may recommend you the following things:</p>
<p>A CT scan or a thyroid ultrasound to know where the abnormal thyroid growth.<br>
A biopsy of the nodule to know whether it is cancerous or non-cancerous<br>
A thyroid medicine to stop the overproduction of thyroid hormones before two weeks<br>
Quit smoking or drinking as it increases complications during the surgery and reduces the healing time.<br>
It is very important to inform your surgeon about the medications you are on. If you are taking any prescription or nonprescription medicine, make sure to ask your doctor if you can take them before the surgical procedure. You may also be asked to stop the blood thinners if you are on them.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>During surgery:</strong></span> <strong>Robotic Thyroidectomy</strong> is performed using the da Vinci Surgical System. The system has:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Four Robotic Hands:</strong></span> These hands are called EndoWrist instruments and they work just like hands. They can grab things, twist and turn and allow surgeons to make precise movements.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>3D camera:</strong> </span>It is an HD camera that gives a 3D image of the thyroid. The surgeon can zoom the image to get a clear view of the thyroid gland using this camera.</p>
<p><strong>Console:</strong> The surgeon performing the surgery sits on the console to control the robotic hands while seeing the images on the camera.</p>
<p>The robotic hands and the camera are inserted via incisions. The thyroid gland is then removed by the surgeon depending on the type of cancer the patient has. The complete system is under the control of the surgeon as the robotic hands cannot move on their own. They perform the movements instructed by the surgeon and the doctors give inputs to the da Vinci system based on the decisions they make during the surgery. The incision made during the surgery is very small, thus making robotic thyroidectomy incredibly popular among people suffering from thyroid cancer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>After Surgery:</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Follow-up &amp; Recovery:</strong> </span>The follow-up and recovery after <strong>thyroid cancer treatment in India</strong> involve several stages.</p>
<p>You will be shifted to the recovery room where your vitals will be monitored as you may feel nauseated from the anaesthesia.</p>
<p>Depending on the outcomes of the<strong> robotic thyroidectomy surgery in Delhi</strong>, the doctor will decide how many days you have to stay in the hospital. During your hospital stay you will be under close observation to avoid any complications.</p>
<p>It is normal to experience pain and discomfort after the surgery, but it can be easily managed with pain medications.You have to keep the incision site clean and dry to prevent any type of infection.<br>
It is better to avoid strenuous physical activities and keep the wound time to heal.<br>
It is important to have regular follow-ups with your surgeon to monitor the progress and make sure that your body is healing perfectly.<br>
Depending on the extent of surgery, ie, partial or complete removal of the thyroid gland, you may be recommended voice rest to give your vocal cords time to heal.<br>
If your entire thyroid gland is removed, you will need to take thyroid replacement hu medication for your entire life. However, the medication will be decided by your healthcare provider.</p>
<p>Precautionary Measures-Essential steps to reduce the risk after the <strong>Scarless Robotic Thyroidectomy in India</strong></p>
<p>Your healthcare provider will inform you of how to care for the incision site, what medications to take, and when to resume normal activities. Follow these instructions carefully to ensure a smooth recovery.<br>
To allow your body to heal, you should rest and avoid strenuous activity after surgery. Do not lift heavy objects or exercise strenuously.<br>
Keep the incision site dry and clean to reduce infection risks. The wound care instructions will be provided by your healthcare provider.<br>
Look for signs of infection at the incision site, including redness, swelling, or pus. If any of these symptoms occur, contact your healthcare provider.<br>
If you experience pain after surgery, take the pain medication prescribed by your healthcare provider. Medications reduce complications and relieve pain.<br>
You may have hoarseness or a change in voice after surgery. You may need voice rest for some time to allow your vocal cords to heal.<br>
If your entire thyroid gland has been removed, you’ll need thyroid hormone replacement medication forever. Monitor your thyroid hormone levels and adjust your medication if necessary.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic Thyroidectomy</strong></span></h2>
<p>The following are the advantages of robotic <strong>thyroidectomy&nbsp; surgery in India</strong> over conventional thyroid surgeries:</p>
<p>No Incision in the Neck ( Cosmetically Compliant Surgery) Unlike traditional thyroid surgeries, the incision is not made in the neck. Very small incisions are made in the underarm or behind the ear. These incisions are very small and hardly visible. Thus robotic thyroidectomy gives better aesthetic outcomes.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>3D View:</strong></span> In traditional surgery, it is only possible to see the thyroid gland from top to bottom. However, using the robotic procedure, the 3D camera gives a magnified view of the thyroid gland which enables surgeons to have a closer look.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Identification of critical structures:</strong></span> Since the 3D camera used in the surgery gives a magnified view, it enables surgeons to see the critical structures of the thyroid gland like the laryngeal nerve and parathyroid glands.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Less Blood Loss:</strong></span> <strong>Robotic Thyroidectomy</strong> is done using small incisions, therefore the blood loss is minimum as compared to the conventional approach.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Dexterity:</strong></span> The robotic hands used during the surgery gives surgeons the freedom to manipulate certain regions of the thyroid gland easily.</p>
<p>Clinical Results (Conventional vs Robotic)</p>
<p>If we compare the clinical results of both robotic thyroidectomy and conventional thyroidectomy, then the results are in favour of the robotic procedure due to the following <span style="color: #008080;"><strong>reasons:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Reduced postoperative pain:</strong></span> People who undergo robotic thyroidectomy experience less pain and thus have fewer pain medications compared to people who choose the traditional surgical technique.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Shorter Hospital Stays:</strong></span> Hospital stays are shorter with robotic thyroidectomy as there is less tissue damage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Better cosmetic outcomes:</strong></span>&nbsp; S<strong>carless Robotic Thyroidectomy Surgery</strong> gives better cosmetic outcomes as the incisions made are extremely small and are hardly visible.</p>

			<h2><b>Nerve Sparing Robotic Prostatectomy in India: Revolutionizing Prostate Cancer Surgery</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 1 in 8 men get prostate cancer in their life. It is one of the most common types of cancer in men and usually affects men in their older age. Early detection and treatment of prostate cancer is essential for the best outcomes of prostate cancer. However, with the advancement in medical science, the survival rate of people who have prostate cancer has increased to five years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scientists have come up with the most advanced surgical option for the treatment of prostate cancer, and that is</span><b> nerve-sparing</b> <b>robotic prostatectomy in India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed with the help of a robot, allowing great precision compared to when surgery is performed by hand. Please keep reading to know more about robotic prostatectomy, including what happens during the surgery and how it is different from other treatment options.</span></p>
<h2><b>Diseases of Prostate: Knowing types of prostate problems men deal with</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prostate diseases include various conditions that affect the prostate gland. The diseases include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prostate Cancer: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a type of cancer that develops in the prostate gland. It is a life-threatening cancer that requires immediate medical attention. Its symptoms include difficulty in urinating, blood in urine, pain in the pelvis, and, above all, erectile dysfunction. The most effective way to treat prostate cancer nowadays is </span><b>nerve-sparing robotic prostatectomy.</b></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Prostatitis</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a disease that causes inflammation of the prostate gland and is caused by harmful bacteria. Its symptoms include pain and discomfort in the prostate area and also cause difficulty in urinating sometimes.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that occurs with age. Its symptoms include difficulty holding urine in the bladder, weak urine flow, frequent urination, and </span><b>a </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">feeling of incomplete bladder emptying.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>Robotic Prostatectomy in India: Where is it needed?</b></h2>
<p><b>Robotic Prostatectomy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a surgical procedure that is used to remove the prostate gland in men who are diagnosed with prostate cancer. This procedure is more suitable for people who are in an early stage of cancer and cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. It is also an appropriate option for people who have failed other treatments like chemotherapy or hormone therapy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the most effective treatment option for some specific types and stages of prostate cancer. However, during </span><b>prostate cancer treatment in India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the decision to undergo a robotic prostatectomy depends on a case-to-case basis, and only an experienced healthcare professional can suggest which treatment option is best for you.</span></p>
<p><b>Nerve Sparing Technique</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The nerve-sparing technique is a crucial aspect of robotic prostatectomy. This technique focuses on preserving neurovascular bundles that control erectile function and urinary continence. By using robotic surgery, surgeons can avoid damaging these vital nerves, leading to better postoperative sexual outcomes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b>Thinking Out Of the Box-Alternative Treatment for Prostate Cancer</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surgery is one of the most common treatments for </span><b>prostate cancer.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The primary goal of surgery is to remove the cancerous tissue from the prostate gland and leave as much healthy tissue as possible. Besides </span><b>robotic prostatectomy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the other surgical options available for prostate cancer are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Open radical prostatectomy: Open radical prostatectom</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">y is a traditional procedure that involves making one large incision in the abdomen or perineum (between the scrotum and anus) to remove the prostate gland. Patients with large tumors or advanced prostate cancer may benefit from this procedure.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy is</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a minimally invasive surgery that removes the prostate gland through multiple small incisions in the abdomen. In India, Laparoscopic Prostatectomy Surgery is guided by a laparoscope (a thin tube with a camera and light).</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Transurethral prostate resection (TURP):</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is a surgery that removes part of the prostate gland through the urethra. This procedure may be recommended for patients with early-stage prostate cancer or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) experiencing urinary symptoms.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><b>The Future of Prostate Cancer Treatment in India The Procedure of Robotic Prostatectomy in India</b></h2>
<p><b>Before the Surgery</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several steps that a patient has to go through before the </span><b>scarless robotic prostatectomy surgery in India. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">These steps ensure the patient is healthy enough for the surgery. It includes:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgeon will first go through the medical history of the patient and will also do a physical examination in which he examines the prostate gland of the patient by inserting a lubricant into the rectum.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood tests are performed to check kidney function and blood cell counts.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imaging tests like MRI and CT scans are ordered to determine the extent of the cancer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the patient meets with the Surgeon before the surgery. It’s an opportunity for the patient to ask questions, discuss concerns, and discover what to expect before, during, and after the surgery. The Surgeon will also review the patient’s medical history and test results to ensure he’s a good candidate for the surgery.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>During the Procedure</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During</span><b> Nerve Sparing Robotic Prostatectomy in India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, six keyhole incisions are made in the abdomen through which trocars are placed to allow the instruments into the abdomen.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The abdomen is then filled with carbon dioxide gas for the operation. At the end of the operation, this gas is removed.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgeon controls the robotic instruments ( da Vinci Robotic System) to perform dissection, cutting, and suturing with dexterity.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Surgeon controls the lens connected to an HD camera, which provides a 3D view of the prostate to the Surgeon.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The prostate is detached from the bladder and urethra, preserving the surrounding nerve tissues. The</span><b> nerve-sparing technique</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> preserves the patient’s ability to achieve spontaneous erections after recovery from the surgery.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At last, the bladder is sewn back to the urethra to restore the continuity of the urinary tract.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Recovery and Follow-Up After the procedure- Keep things in mind.</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be taken to a recovery area to wake up from anesthesia and be monitored after surgery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">To drain urine from the bladder, a catheter will be placed, and medication will be given to manage pain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It usually takes one to two days in the hospital, but it could take longer if a lot is going on.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you become more active and mobile, you will begin with shorter walks around the hospital.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In most cases, the catheter is removed a few days after surgery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a possibility of side effects such as fatigue, urinary incontinence, and erectile dysfunction. With the proper care, these side effects usually go away.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After surgery, the Surgeon will check on the patient to ensure they’re healing well.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is essential to follow the Surgeon’s instructions for post-operative care after </span><b>prostatectomy surgery in India</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including diet and activity restrictions, and to report any unusual symptoms or complications immediately.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Road to Recovery: Preventive measures to take after the surgery</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow your doctor’s instructions carefully for full recovery after the surgery.</span></li>

			<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;">Trans-oral Robotic Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in India&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a health disorder, characterized by patients who display snoring accompanied by irregular breathing patterns while being asleep. The main cause of OSA is the ’obstruction in throat muscles’ – they are normally in a relaxed state but tend to fall backwards during sleep – hence the disease is referred to as obstructive sleep apnea or OSA. It affects 22% of men and 17% of women globally, especially middle-aged overweight adults.</p>
<p>Here we will discuss the best <strong>treatment for sleep apnea in India</strong> and we will also let you know how Cross Border Care will help you.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Which all potential health hazards can OSA cause?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">If left untreated, OSA could tremendously affect quality of life due to a lack of sound sleep. It may further lead to stroke, heart attack, diabetes, sexual disorder, stress and irritability.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>When should one consult a doctor?</strong></span></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Many patients believe that snoring is not related to any illness and is a normal phenomenon; however one should seek consultation from a specialist doctor when:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Snoring starts to interrupt in getting a sound sleep for themselves and others around.</li>
<li>Shortness of breath leads to off-and-on sleep, leading to irregular sleeping patterns.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What treatment options are available to cure sleep apnea in India?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Proper diagnosis of sleep apnea and identification of its cause is the key before treating any sleep apnea patient. Two types of <strong>sleep apnea treatment</strong> options are available:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Non-surgical treatments include:</strong></span></p>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Sleeping on either side to minimize throat muscle obstruction</li>
<li>Following a proper sleeping pattern religiously and getting adequate sleep – this could eventually help in reducing episodes of sleep apnea</li>
<li>Saying goodbye to alcohol right before sleeping time – this helps in increasing airway passage</li>
<li>Regularly exercising – this could help reduce weight and prove beneficial in mild and moderate sleep apnea cases. It is an effective way for treatment of<strong> Obstructive Sleep Apnea in India</strong></li>
<li>Quitting smoking as smoking leads to swelling the throat that could cause obstruction</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Control positive airway pressure (CPAP) mask: </strong></span>This is the most advised treatment option for treating sleep apnea. CPAP mask allows pressurized air to pass through the nose into the airways, thus helping in prevention of obstruction that could happen due to lack of enough oxygen while sleeping. This mask is connected to the device that is supposed to be placed near bedside where patient sleeps – this device helps in pumping the pressurized air. Although it is a non-invasive treatment, but still most patient find it difficult to sleep with the CPAP mask on and are hence unable to comply with it most of the time. Treatment options for such patients include weight reduction, use of oral devices and surgery.</li>
</ol>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What is Trans-Oral Robotic Surgery In India?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Trans-oral Robotic Surgery (TORS) for obstructive sleep apnea in India</strong> is a highly advanced, minimally invasive surgical option for the treatment of OSA. As part of this surgery, to reduce obstruction, the surgeon reduces the base of the tongue through the oral cavity using da Vinci robot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">It is considered as a safe, highly precise surgical treatment option for patients, without having them to suffer serious complications with excellent clinical results that help in improving the quality of life.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In addition to eliminating the existing obstruction in the mouth, throat and nose, the da Vinci robot also empowers the <strong>TORS surgeons</strong> to perform surgery even in the deeper areas of the oral cavity. One of the major benefits in such type of robotic surgery is that it can be customized according to the patient’s need and anatomy.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What should I know before I think of undergoing TORS?</strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">To start with, the surgeon recommends the patient to undergo the sleep study test. To prepare for this test, the patient is required at get admitted in the special sleep lab for a day. The patient is being monitored by a specialist who operates the video camera to observe and record the sleeping patterns and any visible shortcomings.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">There is another alternative test namely ‘sleep endoscopy’ for those who don’t want to wear the CPAP mask during the sleep study. In this procedure, the patient will be given a medicine for sleep. While the patient is still asleep, an endoscope is inserted in the nose and throat to see the site better and understand the extent of obstruction caused to plan and prepare for the robotic surgery. These tests will enable surgeons to identify the needs of <strong>Trans-Oral Robotic Surgery for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in India</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Recovery and Post Operative Care</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;Robotic sleep apnea surgery in Delhi</strong> typically requires a hospital stay of one or two nights for monitoring and recovery. Medical staff will assess your condition and provide appropriate care during this time.</li>
<li>Your surgical site may be sore or uncomfortable. If you have postoperative pain, your surgeon will prescribe pain medication.</li>
<li>Keep any incisions clean and dry to prevent infection. Follow your surgeon’s instructions on wound care, including when to change dressings.</li>
<li>Rest and activity are crucial during recovery. It would help if you avoided strenuous activities, but your surgeon may recommend gentle movements and short walks to promote circulation.</li>
<li>You may be prescribed medications to manage pain or prevent infection. You should take all medications as your surgeon directs and discuss any side effects.</li>
<li>Make sure you attend all your surgeon’s follow-up appointments after <strong>Robotic Sleep Apnea Surgery in India</strong>. You should attend these appointments to monitor your progress, have any sutures removed, and address any concerns.</li>

			<h2><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Robotic CABG Surgery in India: The Future Of Heart Surgeries</span> </strong></h2>
<p>Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) improves blood flow to the heart for patients with blocked arteries. The <strong>robotic CABG surgery</strong> is a relatively new minimally invasive surgical technique. It’s less invasive than conventional open heart surgery, which involves sawing the breastbone in half. It uses surgical robots and a camera attached to a robotic machine, which the heart surgeon controls via a computer console. This minimally invasive technique allows precise control of the surgical instruments through minor cuts (4 to 6 cm) on the side of the chest.</p>
<p>Only skilled surgeons can perform this surgical procedure. Here we will delve into the details of<strong> robotic CABG surgery</strong> and how it is performed in India. We will also inform you about India’s best hospitals and doctors performing this surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What is Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Like all body organs, the heart also needs a constant blood supply. The blood is supplied via two large blood vessels, the left and right coronary arteries. However, these arteries become narrow and hardened over time by depositing fatty acids known as plaques. This is known as atherosclerosis.</p>
<p>People suffering from this disease are said to have coronary heart disease. The best treatment option in India to treat coronary heart disease is <strong>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting,</strong> also known as<strong> CABG.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Understanding CABG</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting, commonly known as CABG, is a surgical procedure performed to improve the blood flow to the heart.</li>
<li>A healthy blood vessel is taken from the leg or chest to bypass the blocked artery.</li>
<li>It is a well-established procedure successfully performed in India to treat CAD for years.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The Emergence of Robotic CABG Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robotic CABG</strong> uses specialized instruments and a 3D camera for high-definition imaging.</li>
<li>Using robotic arms, the surgeon can access the heart through small incisions in the patient’s chest.</li>
<li>A surgeon sits at a console near the operating table and controls the robotic arms with his hands and feet.</li>
<li>A robotic system translates a surgeon’s movement into precise actions, allowing the bypass vessel to graft onto the affected coronary arteries.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>How likely are you to get Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Coronary heart disease is more likely to happen as you get older. You can also get it if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re a smoker</li>
<li>Your weight is out of control</li>
<li>Your diet is high in fat</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What are the common symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease?</strong></span></p>
<p>Coronary artery disease symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pain in your chest</li>
<li>Tiredness on exertion</li>
<li>Feeling palpitations</li>
<li>An abnormal heartbeat</li>
<li>Breathlessness on exertion</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Coronary Artery Bypass surgery: Who needs it?</strong></span></p>
<p>A&nbsp; <strong>robotic CABG surgery in India</strong> restores blood flow around a blocked artery. Surgery is an emergency treatment for a heart attack. In these situations, it may also be recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>A blockage in the left artery is preventing your heart from getting enough blood</li>
<li>Severe narrowing in the central heart artery</li>
<li>A chest pain that’s unbearable</li>
<li>Blockage of more than one artery in the heart</li>
<li>Blockage of a heart artery that can’t be fixed with angioplasty</li>
<li>Angioplasty that didn’t work, with or without a stent.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Diagnosis </strong></span></p>
<p>You can get the following tests before surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li>Electrocardiogram or ECG</li>
<li>A heart ultrasound</li>
<li>Stress Echo</li>
<li>Nuclear cardiac stress test</li>
<li>Angiography</li>
<li>Cardiac CT scan</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Robotic CABG Surgery in Delhi: Understanding the Surgery in Detail</strong></span></h2>
<p>This is the latest treatment option available in India for treating patients suffering from coronary heart disease. Unlike traditional CABG, it is a specialized coronary artery bypass technique that uses robots to perform the surgery. Let us understand this surgery in detail.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<p>To decide if this procedure is correct, your healthcare provider will examine your medical history, lifestyle, and the severity of your condition.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask questions to your healthcare provider about the procedure.</li>
<li>During the procedure, you must sign a consent form. Be bold and ask questions if something needs to be clarified.</li>
<li>Your healthcare provider will do a physical exam and a medical history to ensure your health. Blood tests and other diagnostic tests may also be done.</li>
<li>Tell your healthcare provider if you’re pregnant.</li>
<li>Ensure your healthcare provider knows if you’re sensitive to or allergic to medicines, latex, iodine, tape, contrast dyes, or anaesthetics.</li>
<li>Ensure your doctor knows what you’re taking (prescriptions, over-the-counter, herbal supplements).</li>
<li>You should tell your healthcare provider if you have a bleeding disorder or if you take anticoagulant (blood-thinning) medicine or aspirin. You may have to stop these medicines before the procedure.</li>
<li>You should tell your healthcare provider if you have a pacemaker.</li>
<li>Before the <strong>robotic coronary artery bypass surgery in India</strong>, stop smoking if you smoke. It’ll help you recover from surgery and stay healthy.</li>
<li>After midnight, you can’t eat, drink, or take oral medicine for 8 hours before the procedure.</li>
<li>The doctor may ask you to do other preparations based on your medical condition.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>During the Procedure</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Anesthesia: </strong></span>Before the <strong>Robotic CABG</strong> surgery, the patient is put under general anesthesia to keep them asleep and pain-free.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Surgical Setup:</strong></span> The patient is positioned on an operating table, and tiny incisions are made in the chest. Robotic instruments enter through these small incisions.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Setup of the robotic system</strong></span>: The surgical team sets up the robot, usually the da Vinci Surgical System, which consists of a high-definition 3D camera and robotic arms.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Surgeon Console</strong>:</span> Cardiothoracic surgeons sit at a console near the operating table, controlling robotic arms with their hands and feet. The robotic system turns the surgeon’s movements into precise actions.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Placement of trocars:</strong></span> Trocars are hollow tubes inserted through small incisions. The trocars are used to get the robotic arms into the patient.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Identifying a Bypass Vessel:</strong> </span>The surgeon will choose a healthy blood vessel for the bypass graft, usually from the leg or chest. Grafts are carefully harvested and prepared.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Exposed Coronary Artery</strong>:</span> The surgeon exposes the heart’s narrowed or blocked coronary artery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Grafting the Bypass Vessel:</strong> </span>The surgeon uses robots to attach one end of the bypass vessel to the aorta and the other to the coronary artery beyond the blockage. It bypasses the blocked or narrowed area and restores normal blood flow to the heart.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Verification and Quality Check:</strong></span> After the bypass graft during <span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;<strong>robotic coronary artery bypass surgery in Delhi</strong></span>, the surgeons ensure nothing leaks.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Closure:</strong></span> The robotic instruments are removed once the procedure is complete, and the small incisions are closed with sutures or surgical glue.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What is a graft? Which one is better, venous or arterial? </strong></span></p>
<p>A graft is a blood vessel used to bypass a blocked artery. The most common types of CABG grafts are arterial and venous grafts. Here is a comparison between the two:</p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>After The Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You’ll be moved to the CTVS ICU as soon as the surgery is done.</li>
<li>As soon as your pain is under control, you can keep liquid down without nausea and vomiting, and your labs look normal or close to the baseline, you’ll be discharged.</li>
<li>After you get discharged from the hospital, you can manage your pain with over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.</li>
<li>Keep your incisions clean and dry. Do not use powders, or lotions, on the incision lines, as this can irritate the skin.</li>
<li>After <strong>robotic CABG surgery</strong>, you can return to regular activity more quickly. In most cases, you’ll be able to get back to your routine after a few weeks.</li>
<li>You’ll usually have follow-up appointments with your doctor. Tell your healthcare provider immediately if you experience chest pain or discomfort after the procedure.</li>
<li>Remember to take all or your medicines as prescribed.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic CABG</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Scarring and postoperative pain are reduced with smaller incisions.</li>
<li>Shorter hospital stays and faster recovery are possible with minimal chest trauma.</li>
<li>Surgery can be more precise with high-definition 3D cameras.</li>
<li>The risk of infection and complications is lower than with open-heart surgery.</li>
<li>Patients get discharged after 5 days of surgery</li>
<li>There will be no post-surgical anaemia due to less blood loss during surgery</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Risks in Robotic CABG</strong></span></p>
<p>Despite the numerous benefits of robotic surgery, there are still risks to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are small risks of bleeding, wound infections, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attacks, strokes, and death or the need for further operation in the future<strong>. </strong></li>
<li>Risks vary among individuals depending on the severity of the underlying disease.</li>
<li>You should discuss the risks and benefits with your surgeon before the surgery.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Outcomes and Evidence</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Robotic CABG&nbsp; surgery in India</strong> has shown promising results compared to traditional CABG. Despite a lack of long-term data, initial studies suggest that Robotic CABG is a safe, effective, and open surgery<strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What’s next?</strong></span></p>
<p>Robotic CABG is only going to get better as technology gets better. We could see advancements in robotic platforms, the integration of artificial intelligence, and the expansion of robotic-assisted cardiac procedures.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Limitations of Robotic Surgery </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>A robotic system can be costly, making it a substantial investment for healthcare facilities.</li>
<li><strong>Robotic CABG</strong> requires specialized training for surgeons to master the technology</li>
<li>Rural and less developed areas may not have access to robotic CABG</li>
<li>Not all patients are suitable candidates for robotic CABG, especially obese patients.</li>
<li>Various types of coronary artery disease and valve conditions may not be suitable for robotic CABG.</li>
<li>It may take longer to complete robotic CABG compared to traditional CABG.</li>
<li>&nbsp;The success of R<strong>obotic CABG surgery in Delhi</strong> depends on the robotic system and associated technology. Mistakes or system failures could affect the surgery.</li>

			<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A hip replacement surgery</strong> is recommended when the hip joint becomes severely damaged due to a disease resulting in chronic pain, decreased quality of life and limited mobility.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>A</strong> <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery</strong> is a procedure in which the surgeon removes damaged tissue/femur bone head in a patient’s hip and replaces it with an artificial joint. It is done with the help of a robotic arm hence also called robotic-assisted hip replacement surgery. The robotic procedure allows the surgery to be performed with great precision and also gives miraculous clinical results.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Complex Cases: When is hip replacement surgery needed?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Here are some common conditions when hip replacement surgery is recommended to patients :</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis: </strong></span>&nbsp;It is an autoimmune disorder in which the body’s immune system attacks hip joints, leading to inflammation. In such circumstances, hip replacement becomes necessary to restore the function of the hips.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Hip Fractures: </strong></span>A severe hip fracture can significantly impair the stability and function of hip joints. In such cases, hip replacement is required to repair the fractured bone and restore mobility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Osteoarthritis</strong></span>&nbsp;is the most common cause of <strong>hip replacement surgery in India</strong>. It occurs when the cartilage that cushions the hip joint wears away, thus, leading to joint pain, stiffness and reduced mobility<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Hip Dysplasia: </strong></span>It is a condition in which the hip joint does not develop properly. It leads to pain, instability and degeneration of the hip joint. In such cases, hip replacement becomes necessary to correct the abnormal hip structure<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Avascular Necrosis: </strong></span>This condition occurs when the blood supply to the hip joint gets disrupted which causes death of the bone tissue. This leads to deterioration of the hip joint which causes pain and limited mobility. In such cases, a hip replacement surgery can help.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Different Surgical options available for Hip Replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>&nbsp;Hip replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>, also known as hip arthroplasty is a procedure where the damaged hip joint is replaced with an artificial joint also known as a prosthesis. The different surgical options available for hip replacement in India are:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Traditional Hip Replacement: </strong></span>It is the most common hip replacement surgery performed in India where a surgeon makes an incision either on the side or back of the hip and then removes damaged bone and cartilage. The damaged femur is then replaced by a metal stem<strong>. </strong>A metal o<strong>r </strong>ceramic ball is attached that serves as a hip joint. The damaged socket is also replaced with a metal socket lined with plastic or ceramic.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Partial Hip Replacement: </strong></span>This type of surgery is performed when only the femoral head is fractured but the socket around it is healthy. The femoral head is replaced with a metal prosthesis whereas the socket is left intact.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Hip Resurfacing: </span>I</strong>n this procedure, the femoral head is capped with a metal head instead of removing it completely. The damaged bone and cartilage in the socket are removed and replaced with a metal cup. This surgery is mainly considered for patients who are young and active and have good bone quality.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Robotic Hip Replacement: </strong></span>It is a minimally invasive procedure where small incisions are placed using robotic instruments leading to less tissue disruption and also promises a faster recovery. The procedure is quite similar to conventional surgery except for the very small incisions<strong>. </strong></li>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Precision and Innovation in hip Joint Surgery: When should you consider robotic hip replacement?</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Robotic Hip replacement surgery in Apollo</strong> hospital can be considered under the following circumstances:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Complex anatomy</strong>:</span> Patients with complicated hip anatomy, like deformities or unusual bones, may benefit from robotics. Using the robotic system, doctors can do a more precise assessment and tailor their approach to the surgery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Problems with Traditional Techniques</strong>:</span> Patients with previous hip surgeries, joint deformities, or challenging anatomical variations might benefit from robotic assistance. Robotic systems can navigate and adapt to these complexities, so they can achieve optimal results.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Younger, more active patients</strong>:</span> <strong>Robotic hip replacement surgery in India</strong> may appeal to younger patients who live an active lifestyle and want to get back to their regular routines quicker. This group of patients might benefit from robotic assistance, like reduced tissue damage and better implant positioning.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Precision and Accuracy: The Revolutionary Impact of Robotic Hip Replacement ( Know the complete procedure)</strong></span></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the surgery: </strong></span></h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Several steps are taken initially to ensure that the surgical procedure guarantees the desired outcome. These steps include:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The process begins with an initial consultation with the surgeon who is a specialist in robotic hip replacement. The entire medical history will be evaluated to make sure that you are the perfect candidate for the procedure. It includes X-rays and MRI scans to determine the extent of damage.</li>
<li>You may also be suggested to go through some preoperative tests like blood tests, ECG and other necessary evaluations performed to determine your overall health.</li>
<li>In <strong>robotic surgery,</strong> advanced imaging techniques are used to create a 3D model of the hip joint. Combined with X-ray reports and CT reports, the results of imaging help the surgeon to create a precise treatment option for you.</li>
<li>You will then be given detailed information about the procedure like risks, benefits and recovery time after the surgery. In this step, you will get an opportunity to clear all your doubts with your surgeon.</li>
<li>You’ll get specific instructions about preoperative prep for <strong>hip replacement surgery.</strong> It might include tips on fasting before surgery, stopping or continuing medication, and changing your lifestyle. Exercises or physical therapy might also be recommended to strengthen hip muscles and get fitter.</li>
<li>A consultation with an anesthesiologist can be conducted to evaluate your suitability for anaesthesia and discuss pain management options.</li>
<li>In case there are underlying medical conditions identified during the evaluation you may be referred to another specialist for further management and optimization of your health. Depending on the case, you might need to see a cardiologist, pulmonologist, or other specialist.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The surgical team will first prepare the surgical site by cleaning and sterilizing it.</li>
<li>The surgeon will then make a small incision near the hip joint. The location of the incision differs from case to case depending on the patient factors.</li>
<li>The surgeon then used specialized instruments to cut and remove damaged bone as well as cartilage, thus preparing the area for the placement of implants.</li>
<li>The robotic system is then calibrated. It involves attaching tracking devices to the legs of the patient and then connecting them to the robotic arm.</li>
<li>The robotic arm is then utilized to position the implants precisely to the desired area.</li>
<li>Artificial implants include a metal stem, ball and socket that are then inserted into the hip joint during <strong>hip replacement surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></li>
<li>The robotic system allows the surgeon to make changes to the plan for the best possible placement of implants.</li>
<li>Once the implants are inserted at the right place, the incisions are closed and sterile dressings are applied to the operated area.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Recovery after the surgery: The Immediate Postoperative Care You Need</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>You need immediate post-op care after <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery in Delhi.</strong>&nbsp;The type of anaesthesia the patient gets depends on their pre-anaesthesia checkup. Usually, it takes 1.5-2 hours to do the whole thing.</li>
<li>After that, the patient is shifted to the recovery room for monitoring. The recovery from robotic-assisted surgery usually takes 3-4 days since it’s minimally invasive and causes minimal muscle and ligament damage.</li>
<li>You’ll start walking with a walker the day after surgery. It takes 4-6 weeks for you to recover</li>
<li>Initially, you can’t sit on the floor and use a commode below 18 inches high.</li>
<li>In the two months following surgery, you’ll need a high-calcium diet and supplements.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Safe Return to Daily Life: Precautions to follow</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Your surgeon will give you specific instructions about weight-bearing and activity restrictions. Initially, you’ll need to use crutches or a walker and avoid putting full weight on the leg. You’ll gradually be able to increase weight bearing and participate in specific exercises and activities as your surgeon directs.</li>
<li>To prevent infection and promote healing after <strong>robotic hip replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>, take good care of your incision site. Keep your incision clean and dry by changing dressings and following your surgeon’s instructions. Tell your healthcare provider if you have redness, swelling, drainage, or fever.</li>
<li>Make sure you follow the recommended measures to prevent blood clots. You’ll need compression stockings, blood thinners, and leg exercises as directed by your healthcare team, as well as taking prescribed blood thinners.</li>
<li>Take all prescribed medications as directed, including pain meds, antibiotics, and other prescriptions for your specific needs. Take your medication as prescribed to manage pain, prevent infection, and support healing.</li>
<li>Regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon after<strong> hip replacement surgery</strong> are essential to tracking your progress, assessing healing, and making any necessary adjustments to your postoperative care plan. During your recovery, make sure you attend all your appointments and communicate any concerns or issues you might have.</li>
<li>Physical therapy is important for rehabilitation. Be sure to follow your physical therapist’s instructions and participate in your exercise program. It’ll help improve balance, strengthen muscles, and restore joint mobility</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Advantages of Robotic Hip Replacement : The Life Transforming Hip Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="color: #000000;">Creating a patient-specific 3D model of the hip joint:</span> </strong></span>The robotic surgery planning system makes a 3D model of the hip joint based on the patient’s anatomy. A surgeon can visualize the surgery and plan it based on the patient’s unique anatomy.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Better Control: </strong></span>The robotic arm adds accuracy and consistency to the surgeon’s hand. By doing this, the femur can be cut, the acetabulum can be reammed, and the implant components can be placed with more accuracy. As a result of robotics, inaccuracies can be reduced by up to 94%, reducing risks of leg length shortening, dislocations, and other complications.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Safe Zone: </strong></span>All surgical cutting and reaming tools remain within the safe zone thanks to the specifications of the 3D model of the hip. As a result, you can make sure the implant components are angled and positioned as planned.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Robotic Surgery: </strong></span>With its highly precise movements, the robotic arm can operate in tight spaces and through smaller incisions. As a result, surrounding tissues get minimal damage. <strong>Robotic hip replacement surgery in India</strong> is minimally invasive and doesn’t cut any muscles around the hip.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Enhanced Outcomes: </strong></span>A study published by the American Hip Institute followed 162 patients who underwent robot-assisted hip replacement surgery for 2 years. It’s true! These patients experienced it and confirmed it.</li>

<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Cost of robotic hip replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">In India, there are many factors which determine the<strong> cost of hip replacement surgery</strong> such as:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Technology Used</strong>: </span>Othopedicians in India are using three techniques to replace damaged or diseased hip joints. These techniques are open, minimal access and robotics. The latest and most accurate technique is robotic hence more expensive than conventional surgery.</li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Quality of implant</strong>:</span> There are two types of implants available in India, imported and local Indian implants are cheap but long-lasting. Imported implants such as Stryker, Johnson &amp; Johnson and Zimmer are the best in the industry hence expensive but long-lasting. These implants may last for 25 -30 years if replaced through robots due to better alignment and less trauma after surgery. Type of implant used determines <span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>hip replacement surgery cost in India</strong>“</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Other factors: </strong></span>The cost also depends on credentialing, privileges and experience of an orthopaedic surgeon. Hospital brand, type, size, its quality certificate whether it is following JCI protocols or NABH protocols plays a vital role in costing. Big brands such as Apollo, Max, Fortis and Medanta follow American clinical protocols, hence they are expensive. <strong>R</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>obotic hip replacement surgery cost in Delhi</strong> is high </span>since they follow good quality standards concerning second or third tier cities.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery- Transforming Knee Replacement&nbsp; </strong><strong>Surgery for Better Lives</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Robotic knee replacement surgery</strong> </span>is often called Knee arthroplasty surgery. This can help reduce discomfort and restore function in severely damaged knee joints. This operation entails removing diseased bone and cartilage from the lower end of the thighbone, upper end of the shinbone, and kneecap and replacing it with an implant consisting of metal alloys, high-grade plastics, and polymers to make an artificial joint. This new joint is designed and aligned to mimic the function of normal human joints.</p>
<p>It becomes mandatory for patients who are in pain due to an injury in their knee joint and when no other therapy seems to be working. This may commonly be caused by age-related osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>When Pain Rules: Understanding the Need for Knee Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;A knee replacement surgery</strong> is typically considered when all other treatment options fail to provide relief for chronic knee pain. Here are some common situations when a person has to go for knee replacement surgery:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Osteoarthritis:</strong> </span>It is one of the most common reasons for knee replacement. If traditional treatment options like pain medications, and physical therapy fail to provide relief, then knee replacement is the ultimate option.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis: </strong></span>It is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation in knee joints. If the inflammation cannot be controlled via pain medications, then knee replacement is the last option considered by the doctors.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Knee Deformity:</strong> </span>Severe knee deformities like bowing in or out of the knee, can lead to uneven distribution of weight and excessive joint wear. In such cases, <strong>knee replacement surgery in India</strong> is suggested to restore normal knee function.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Failed surgeries:</strong></span> In some cases, previous knee surgeries like arthroscopy or partial knee replacement may not have provided complete relief. A total knee replacement is considered a salvage option.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Other cases: </strong></span>Knee replacement is also recommended for patients suffering from avascular necrosis, knee tumors, and severe knee joint infections.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Exploring Different surgical options available for Knee Replacement in India</strong></span></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Total knee replacement (TKR): </strong></span>This involves replacing the whole knee joint with artificial implants. To recreate the joint, the damaged cartilage and bone are removed and replaced with metal and plastic implants. TKR relieves joint pain, improves function, and restores mobility.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Partial Knee Replacements (PKRs): </strong></span>Also known as unicompartmental <strong>knee replacement surgery in Apollo</strong> Hospital, India, PKRs are done when only one compartment of the knee joint is damaged. During this procedure, only the damaged section of the knee is replaced with a prosthesis, preserving the healthy parts<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Bilateral knee replacement: </strong></span>This involves replacing both knees at the same time. The procedure is good for patients with severe arthritis or damage to both knees, so they can recover and rehabilitate simultaneously.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Robotic-assisted knee replacement: </strong></span>A robotic arm system helps the surgeon with the knee replacement. It can increase precision, and accuracy, and allow a more customized implant fit, which can lead to better results.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Choosing the right knee replacement option for your needs: A detailed look at the different options available to you</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Robotic-assisted<strong> knee replacement surgery in Delhi</strong> involves the use of a robot to assist the surgeon during the knee replacement procedure. Different types of robotic knee surgeries performed in India are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Fully Automatic Knee Replacement: </strong></span>In this procedure, the entire surgery is performed by the robot with minimal or no input from the surgeon. It uses preoperative imaging data and advanced algorithms to plan and execute surgeries. Robotic systems use sensors and artificial intelligence to make adjustments in real-time to align implants and ensure they’re positioned correctly. In most cases, surgeons oversee the process and can intervene, but it’s mostly autonomous.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Partially Automatic Knee Replacement: </strong></span>In a partially <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in India</strong>, there is a collaboration between the robotic system and the surgeon. The system provides real-time feedback to the surgeon and also guides the surgeon during the procedure. The surgeon takes control of the surgery and makes important decisions while the robotic system helps to enhance accuracy and precision during the procedure.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Mako Robotic Knee Replacement-Empowering Patients with Precision and Accuracy</strong></span></h2>
<p>Over the years, knee replacement techniques and instrumentation have gone through countless improvements. In this technique, surgery is performed by a surgeon using a <strong>Mako Robotic Arm</strong>. The Mako system pre-plan your surgery and then the surgeon guides the arm to remove diseased bone or cartilage from the knee. The surgeon will then insert the implant. <strong>Mako technology</strong> was developed to provide a personalized surgical experience to patients based on their specific diagnoses and anatomy.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Mako Robotic Knee Replacement Surgery in India – Know the complete procedure</strong></span></h2>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>You will be advised to go through a comprehensive preoperative evaluation with the orthopedic surgeon to determine if you are a good candidate. A physical exam and diagnostic are part of this evaluation.</li>
<li>The surgeon will then discuss the benefits, risks, and expected outcomes of robotic knee replacement surgery. You can also ask any questions you have. A detailed list of preoperative instructions will be given, including medication management, fasting guidelines, and medications to stop.</li>
<li>X-rays and CT scans are used to create a 3D model of the knee joint using advanced imaging techniques. Imaging data is used in conjunction with specialized software to develop a surgical plan. The surgeon can see how bad the joint is, plan the implant positioning and alignment, and determine which prosthetic pieces are the right size and fit.</li>
<li>You may be advised to undergo preoperative medical clearance in the days leading up to&nbsp; <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in Apollo Hospital,</strong> which might include blood tests, ECGs, and other exams.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>During the Surgery: </strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The surgery begins with a CT scan of the knee joint that is used to generate a virtual 3D model. This model is then loaded into the Mako System software and is used to create a personalized treatment plan.</li>
<li>The robotic arm and the pre-operative plan are synced and the arthritic portions of the bone appear green on the 3D model.</li>
<li>The surgeon then guides the robotic arm to remove the damaged bone. With the use of Haptic technology, the surgeon only removed the damaged area eliminating the risk of damaging the healthy bone and ligaments.</li>
<li>The Mako robot provides the exact coordinates to the surgeon for the implants. It also confirms the gaps on the inside and outside of the knee remain the same throughout the arc of motion. This results in a knee that moves efficiently with a perfect balance.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Recovery After the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Robotic knee replacements usually heal quicker than traditional knee replacements.</li>
<li>Most people return home the same day after surgery and can walk within a few hours</li>
<li>It takes about 3-6 weeks for you to fully recover from <strong>robotic knee replacement surgery in Delhi</strong>.</li>
<li>There may be a need for physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the knee.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Precautions to follow after the surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Strictly adhere to the post-operative instructions provided by the surgeon to ensure maximum recovery.</li>
<li>Take pain medications on time to avoid severe pain and discomfort.</li>
<li>Take complete rest and do gentle movements after the surgery. Avoid heavy exercises or any kind of movement that can strain the surgical area.</li>
<li>Avoid smoking and drinking alcohol because excessive drinking and smoking can interfere with the recovery process.</li>
<li>Make sure to attend all the follow-up appointments with your doctor to avoid any future complications.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Traditional vs. Robotic Surgery for Knee Replacement- Which is Better?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In the last few decades, knee replacement surgery has been the preferred treatment. This method relies heavily on X-rays for visual evaluation and manual direction.</p>
<p><strong>Traditional total knee replacement surgery</strong> involves an incision around 10 to 12 inches long. While this was the procedure used for a while and it helped patients. It’s invasive, painful, and takes a while to recover. Additionally, because conventional knee replacement surgery relies on vision and human judgment and the technique relies on bone section and soft tissue balance, it’s more likely to misalign.</p>
<p>In robotic TKA, dynamic referencing is used to assess knee stability, alignment, and range of motion while operating on the patient. This allows adjustments to be made to bone resection and prosthesis positioning during surgery. Due to the limited soft-tissue dissection and muscle injury, inflammation is reduced.</p>
<p>Compared to conventional knee replacement, <strong>robotic knee replacement</strong> has less pain, less blood loss, shorter hospital stays, and better flexion and straight leg tests after surgery on discharge.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>The Profound Benefits of Robotic Knee Replacement</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Robotic Knee Replacement surgery has the following advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Enhanced Precision: </strong></span>Robotic Assisted Knee Replacement offers enhanced precision and accuracy. The computer system uses advanced algorithms to create a 3D model of the knee which helps the surgeon to perform the procedure with greater precision.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Personalized Treatment: </strong></span>The anatomy of every patient is unique and the robotic system helps to create a customized surgical plan for every individual. The pre-operative planning ensures a correct implant size and alignment. With such advantages, the outcomes are better.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Small Incisions: </strong></span>As compared to conventional knee replacement,<strong> robotic knee replacement surgery in India</strong>&nbsp;allows small incisions. It allows accurate bone preparation which helps to preserve healthy bone and soft tissue.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Fewer Complications: </strong></span>Since robotic surgery is extremely precise, it has fewer complications. Accurate implant positioning and alignment decrease the chances of implant loosening leading to improved longevity and better outcomes.</li>

			<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Blade free cataract surgery all you need to know</strong></span></h2>
<p>Femtosecond laser cataract surgery is the latest and most advanced robotic technology for the treatment of cataracts, and it has significant advantages over traditional cataract surgery t.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Why Robotic Femtosecond laser?</strong></span></p>
<p>When it comes to the technology used in femtosecond laser cataract surgery, India is at the forefront. Many of the hospitals and eye clinics in India are equipped with the latest femtosecond laser technology, which allows for more precise, fast and less invasive surgery. Actual working time of the laser is less than a minute.<br>
The femtosecond robot can perform some of the most critical steps of the surgery, such as creating corneal incisions and fragmenting the cataract, with greater accuracy and safety than traditional manual techniques. This leads to better visual outcomes, quicker recovery times, and a reduced risk of complications since it is 100% blade and suture free surgery.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Why Robotic Cataract Surgery in India?</strong></span></h2>
<p>In India, femtosecond laser cataract surgery is becoming increasingly popular due to its numerous benefits, including lower waiting times, highly qualified doctors, and more affordable treatment costs.<br>
Another significant advantage of choosing India for femtosecond laser cataract surgery is the low waiting times. Due to the high demand for medical services in other countries, the waiting times for cataract surgery can be quite long, sometimes months or even years. In India, however, patients can usually get the surgery they need without having to wait for an extended period. This is because India has a vast network of hospitals and clinics that are equipped with the latest technology and staffed by highly qualified doctors.<br>
Speaking of highly qualified doctors, India is renowned for producing some of the best medical professionals in the world. Indian doctors are highly educated, with many having trained in some of the most prestigious medical schools in the world. They are also well-versed in the latest medical technologies and techniques, including femtosecond laser cataract surgery. This means that patients who undergo this surgery in India can be assured that they are receiving the highest standard of care from some of the best doctors in the world.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Why Choose Us for Robotic Cataract Surgery?</strong></span><br>
In addition to the advantages mentioned above, there are also other benefits to undergoing femtosecond laser cataract surgery in India. For example, many hospitals and clinics in India offer comprehensive surgical packages that include everything from transportation and accommodation to sightseeing and post-operative care. This can make the entire experience of getting cataract surgery in India much more comfortable and enjoyable for patients.</p>

<h2><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Factors that Affect Robotic Cataract Surgery in India</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cataract surgeries have become faster and hassle free with the new technology that uses laser system to operate on cataract patients. Also known as robotic cataract surgery, this technology uses femtosecond laser machine and the incision into cornea is made using a robot. The whole surgery gets completed in 30 seconds. Here are some factors that effet the robotioc cataract surgery in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Severe Eye Conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients having severe eye condition like glaucoma , advanced diabetic retinopathy or macular degeneration may not be suitable for robotic cataract surgery due to the risks involved in the surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Previous Eye Surgery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patinets who have undergone multiple eye surgeries or have had complications from previous surgeries, may not be the suitable candidate for the cataract surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Abnormalities in Cornea: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">People who have corneal abnormalieties like :&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Irregular astigmatism</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corneal scarring&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thin corneas</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These people are not suitable candidate of the robotic cataract surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>General Health Conditions: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients with significant health issues like&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Uncontrolled diabetes</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hypertension</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Auto immune disorders</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are not the suitable candidates of the robotic cataract surgery as these conditions slow down the healing and increase risk of complications.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Mature Cataract: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mature cataract is an advanced stage of cataract development where the lens of the ye becomes clouded and leads to vision impairment. Performing robotic cataract surgery becomes difficult in such situations due to hard nature of lens. It becomes difficult for robotic system to remove cataract material in such cases.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Small Non Dilating Pupil: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">it is a condition when pupil size is insufficiently large or fails to dilate during the surgical procedure. A small pupil will limit the access to the lens and thus make it challenging for the robot.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Cost Factors: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Robotic Cataract surgery is more costly than traditional cataract surgery. If you considering it, you should take your financial condition in account and also check insurance coverage before opting this procedure.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Cost of Robotic&nbsp; Cataract Surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p>One of the primary advantages of undergoing femtosecond laser cataract surgery in India is the lower cost of treatment.<br>
India is known for providing world-class medical care at a fraction of the cost of other countries.<br>
The cost of femtosecond laser cataract surgery in India is much lower than in Western countries, making it a more affordable option for patients from around the world.<br>
The cost mainly depends on the technology used and type and make of Intra Ocular lenses (IOL). Indian made IOL is cheaper than American brands.<br>
In addition to this robotic and MICS are always expensive as they are painless, suture less surgeries.</p>

			<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Cutting-edge Brain Tumor Surgery in India: Advanced Treatment for Best Outcomes</strong></span></h2>
<p>A brain tumor is an abnormal growth of cells in the brain. It can develop anywhere in the brain, such as the protective lining, skull base, brainstem, nasal cavity, and more. There are estimated to be 120 different types of brain tumors. Throughout this article, we’ll explore brain tumor types, symptoms, causes, and <strong>brain tumor surgery in India</strong>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>A look at the different types of brain tumors</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>There are two types of brain tumors:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Benign:</strong></span> These brain tumors don’t grow fast and have well-defined borders. There’s no invasion or spread to other body parts, as they are non-cancerous.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Malignant:</strong> </span>These brain tumors grow fast and are cancerous. Aside from invading nearby areas, they spread to different body parts. They’re the most aggressive form of brain tumor and can be deadly.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Brain Tumor Surgery in Delhi: Understanding the Types&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Gliomas: </strong></span>This type of tumor starts in the nerve cells in the brain. Although the tumors can be benign, they’re primarily malignant. The most common malignant brain tumor is glioblastoma.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Choroid Plexus Tumors: </strong></span>These tumors start in the cells that make the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. They can be benign or malignant, and most are in kids.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Embryonic Tumors: </strong></span>These start from cells in the brain after birth. They’re malignant brain tumors that primarily affect babies.</p>
<p>Germ cell tumors start from reproductive cells that become eggs and sperm. They are usually found in the ovaries and testes, but they can also be found in the brain. Children tend to get germ cell tumors more often, and they’re usually benign.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pineal Tumors: </strong></span>Pineal Tumors start around and inside the pineal gland. It’s common for children and adults to get these tumors, which can be benign or malignant.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Nerve tumors:</span></strong> Doctors doing <strong>brain tumor surgery in India</strong> say that these are tumors in or around nerves. This happens on the main nerve that connects the inner ear with the brain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pituitary Tumors: </strong></span>These start in or around the pituitary gland and are usually benign. In some cases, the tumor happens in the pituitary gland, a small gland at the base of the brain.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Brain Tumor Surgery India: Silent Signals to Help Us Recognize Them</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;">Some common symptoms of brain tumors are:</span></h3>
<p>● A brain tumor is characterized by persistent headaches, especially in the morning, vomiting, and nausea.</p>
<p>● The most common symptom of brain tumors is seizures, especially in people without a history of seizures.</p>
<p>● People with <strong>brain tumors</strong> can suffer from memory problems and other mental problems like thinking, reasoning, and solving problems.</p>
<p>● A brain tumor near the optic nerve can seriously damage hearing and cause double vision or partial or complete blindness.</p>
<p>● A brain tumor can affect your balance and coordination because it affects your cerebellum.</p>
<p>● A <strong>brain tumor</strong> increases intracranial pressure, leading to nausea and vomiting, especially in the morning.</p>
<p>● The nervous system can be severely harmed by tumors, causing numbness and weakness in the legs and other parts.</p>
<p>● Brain tumors can also damage the parts of the brain that control speech and language. Hence, someone with a brain tumor might slur their speech, have trouble finding words, etc.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>How is a brain tumor diagnosed?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Diagnosis of a brain tumor before <strong>minimal access brain tumor surgery in India</strong> begins with a detailed neurological exam. The physical tests include:</p>
<ul>
<li>C.T. Scan of Head</li>
<li>MRI Brain</li>
<li>Angiography of the brain arteries</li>
<li>Skull X-Ray</li>
<li>Biopsy of the brain tissue</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Brain Tumor Surgery India: Latest Treatment Options Available</strong></span></h2>
<p>Neurosurgery, Radiotherapy, or chemotherapy are the most widely used treatment modalities. However, with the advancement in medical technology, new treatments have been devised in India to cure people suffering from brain tumors. Some of these treatments are:</p>
<p><strong>Neuroendoscopy surgery</strong> is a <strong>minimally invasive brain tumor surgery</strong> used to treat brain tumors using an endoscope. It allows surgeons to visualize and perform the surgical area using small incisions through natural body openings like the nose and mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Gamma Knife Surgery</strong>: <strong>Gamma knife surgery</strong> is also known as stereotactic surgery. It is a noninvasive surgical technique that uses a particular device known as a gamma knife. It is a helmet-like structure containing cobalt-60 radiation sources. The radiation damages the DNA of the targeted cells so that the tumor does not grow further.</p>
<p><strong>Cyberknife</strong>: It’s a noninvasive <strong>robotic radiosurgery </strong>system for treating brain tumors. It delivers high-dose radiation with real-time adjustments for patient movement. It’s painless, outpatient, and has minimal side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Proton Therapy</strong>: Proton therapy uses protons instead of X-rays to treat cancer. The radiation is highly targeted, so there’s less damage to healthy tissue around it. This treatment is perfect for treating tumors near critical structures and in kids since it’s more precise and has fewer side effects.</p>
<p><strong>Targeted drug therap</strong>y-&nbsp; <strong>Targeted drug therapy</strong>, or precision medicine, uses drugs to target genetic mutations or molecules involved in the growth of cancer cells.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Craniotomy: </strong>It is a type of <strong>brain tumor surgery in Indi</strong>a that involves opening the skull to gain access to the brain tumor.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Craniotomy: A detailed look into the most popular brain tumor surgery in India</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>A craniotomy is a<strong> brain surgery</strong> where the neurosurgeon opens a piece of the skull to reach the brain. The same piece of skull is reapplied after the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Exploring Different Types of Craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are several types of craniotomy procedures. The type depends on where the surgeon accesses your skull. The significant types of craniotomy surgeries include:</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Stereotactic craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>Stereotactic craniotomies use MRI or C.T. scans. During this procedure of your <strong>brain tumor surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital,</strong> your surgeon takes pictures of your brain in three dimensions. It helps them distinguish between healthy and abnormal tissue. In addition, stereotactic techniques help your surgeon find the best spot to cut your scalp. This makes it easier to make minor cuts and do minimally invasive surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Endoscopic craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>During an<strong> endoscopic brain tumor surgery in Delhi</strong>, your surgeon makes a tiny hole in your skull. Then, they insert an endoscope, a small camera with lights. It’s commonly used with keyhole craniotomies.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Awake craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>The awake craniotomy is done while you’re awake. During surgery, your surgeon monitors your brain activity while asking you questions. They’ll tell you which parts of the brain control speech, movement, and vision as you respond. While performing the surgery, they’ll avoid these areas.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Keyhole craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>Keyhole craniotomies remove brain tumors. This is a <strong>minimally invasive brain tumor surgery</strong> with less scarring and a faster recovery. First, you’ll get a small cut behind your ear. Then, through this incision, the brain tumor is removed.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Supra-orbital ‘eyebrow’ craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>To remove brain tumors from your forehead, you have a supra-orbital craniotomy. A small cut is made on your eyebrow. The procedure is minimally invasive and leaves minimal scars.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pteronial (frontotemporal) craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>The frontal, temporal, sphenoid, and parietal bones meet in a pterion. You’ll find it on the side of your skull near your temple. During a personal craniotomy, part of the pterion is removed. Next, your surgeon makes an incision behind your hairline so they can access multiple parts of your brain.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Orbitozygomatic craniotomy</strong></span></p>
<p>Orbitozygomatic craniotomies are suitable for challenging tumors and aneurysms. First, there’s a small incision behind your hairline. In this procedure, your surgeon removes part of the bone that curves around your eye socket and cheek. It lets your surgeon reach deeper regions of your brain while reducing damage.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Craniotomy of the posterior fossa</strong></span></p>
<p>The lower part of the skull is the posterior fossa. This part of the brain is near the brainstem and cerebellum, which controls balance and coordination. Tumors in the posterior fossa can put pressure on the cerebellum, brain stem, and spinal cord. A <strong>craniotomy</strong> in the posterior fossa can get rid of the tumor. This is done through an incision at the base of your skull.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Craniotomy Procedure: Understanding the complete procedure of brain tumor surgery in India step-by-step</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery:</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Various tests are performed before the<strong> brain tumor surgery</strong>, like a physical exam, blood tests, neurological exam, and a C.T. scan or an MRI.</li>
<li>Your surgeon will also determine the surgical site and the type of craniotomy he will perform on you. The surgeon will also discuss potential risks and a detailed treatment plan with expected outcomes.</li>
<li>Some pre-operative tests, such as ECG and pulmonary function tests, are performed before the surgery to determine the patient’s overall health.</li>
<li>You will also be instructed to fast a day before the surgery.</li>
<li>A consultation with an anesthesiologist will help to determine the most appropriate anesthesia technique required for <strong>brain tumor surgery in India</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>During the surgery:</strong></span></h3>
<p>The following steps are performed to treat brain tumors:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Anesthesia:</span> </strong>The surgery starts with giving anesthesia to the patient to ensure they remain pain-free throughout the surgery.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Incision: </strong></span>Various types of incisions are made depending on the affected area of the brain. It can be made behind the hairline, in front of the ear, or anywhere else. If an endoscope is used, the incision made will be small. After the incision, a blonde flap is removed carefully.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Surgery: </strong></span>After removing the flap, the surgeon will assess the brain. The surgeon will then remove the tumor using specialized instruments.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Intraoperative Monitoring and Navigation:</strong></span> The surgeon can use intraoperative monitoring techniques to check brain function and ensure critical parts are safe during the procedure. It can involve monitoring electrical activity, blood flow, or nerve activity. In some cases, image-guided navigation can help locate the surgical target precisely.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Closure and recovery</strong>:</span> After the <strong>endoscopic brain tumor surgery in India</strong>, the surgeon replaces the bone flap with plates, screws, or wires to hold it in place. Usually, sutures or staples are used to close the scalp incision. Following surgery, they will be transferred to the recovery room, where they will be closely monitored.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>Immediately after the surgery, you will be taken to the recovery room and kept under observation.</li>
<li>The recovery period depends on the type of surgery done and the type of anesthesia given.</li>
<li>You may need oxygen for some amount of time after the surgery. However, it is discontinued when you will go home after the surgery.</li>
<li>You will also be taught specific deep breathing exercises to prevent pneumonia.</li>
<li>
<h3>Frequent neurological checks are done after the surgery to ensure the brain works correctly.</h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Precautions after the Surgery</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Following the instructions provided by your healthcare team after the surgery is essential.</li>
<li>Take proper care of the incision to prevent infection. Keep the incision clean to avoid infection and swelling.</li>
<li>Maintain an elevated head position to reduce swelling in the surgical area.</li>
<li>They have limited physical activities, as advised by the surgeon. Avoid heavy exercises to avoid any strain at the surgical site.</li>
<li>Take medicines at time to manage pain and infection. Do not stop or alter medications at your own will.</li>
<li>Take sufficient rest as it fastracks the recovery process. Listen to your body and avoid pushing it too hard.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Advantages of Craniotomy: Enhancing Neurological Health and Well Being</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li>A<strong> craniotomy surgery in India allows</strong>&nbsp;neurosurgeons to get directly to tumors and remove them. In this procedure, the tumor can be located precisely and resected maximally for improved outcomes.</li>
<li>Brain biopsies allow neurosurgeons to make accurate diagnoses. This allows for more targeted and personalized treatment choices.</li>
<li>Specialized monitoring techniques can assess brain function, such as electrical activity and blood flow, during a craniotomy. Real-time monitoring minimizes complications and ensures safety during surgery.</li>
<li>Advanced imaging techniques, such as MRIs and CT scans, can be integrated with surgical navigation. With this technology, surgeons can find their surgical targets accurately, enhance precision, and minimize damage to nearby healthy brain tissue.</li>
<li>Each craniotomy procedure is tailored to a patient’s specific condition. Surgeons can optimize patient outcomes based on the location, size, and nature of the pathology.</li>
<li><strong>Craniotomy surgery in Delhi</strong> continues to improve through advances in surgical techniques, imaging technologies, and intraoperative monitoring tools. With these advances, surgery is more precise, minimally invasive, and safe.</li>

			<h2><span lang="EN" style="color: #008080;">The Trans-Nasal Trans-sphenoidal (TNTS) Surgery in India: Treating Pituitary Gland Tumors</span></h2>
<p>Pituitary Tumors develop in the pituitary gland, which is about the size of a pea and located at the base of the skull. They may produce too many hormones that control various body functions.</p>
<p>Most of these tumors are benign, which means they are noncancerous. They can be removed with <strong>pituitary tumor surgery in India</strong>, and their growth can be controlled via radiation and medications.</p>
<p><strong>Pituitary gland tumors</strong> can be treated in several ways. Here, we will focus on the most popular surgery: Endoscopic surgery. We will also discuss the types of pituitary tumors and their associated symptoms. Let us delve into the details one by one.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Types of Pituitary Tumors</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>There are three kinds of pituitary tumors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pituitary benign adenomas:</strong></span> Those aren’t cancerous. A pituitary tumor grows slowly and doesn’t spread.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>‘Invasive pituitary adenomas:</strong></span> Benign tumors that can spread to the skull or sinus cavity.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pituitary carcinomas</strong>:</span> Cancerous tumors in the pituitary gland. They can spread to other parts of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or even outside of it. There are very few malignant pituitary tumors.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Depending on the type and size of the tumor, the pituitary function may be impaired or normal</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>A non-functioning pituitary tumor doesn’t make extra hormones.</li>
<li>A functioning pituitary tumor produces more than normal hormones. Pituitary tumors are usually functioning ones.</li>
<li>The extra hormones made by pituitary tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of the disease.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Recognizing The Symptoms of Pituitary tumor</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>Pituitary tumors</strong> can press on or damage parts of the pituitary gland; thus, producing one or more hormones stops. The too little hormone will affect the gland or organ it controls. You might get these signs and symptoms if you are suffering from a pituitary gland tumor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some loss of vision.</li>
<li>Loss of body hair.</li>
<li>Women have less frequent or no menstrual periods or milk from the breasts.</li>
<li>In men, facial hair loss, breast tissue growth, and impotence.</li>
<li>In women and men, lower sex drive.</li>
<li>In children, growth impairment and delayed sexual development.</li>
<li><strong>Too much prolactin causes</strong> infertility in women and impotence in men.</li>
<li><strong>Too much ACTH may cause</strong> weight gain. Thin skin may have purple or pink stretch marks on the chest or abdomen.</li>
<li><strong>Too much growth hormone may cause</strong> adults to have acromegaly (growth of the bones in the face, hands, and feet). In children, the whole body may grow much taller and more extensive than usual.</li>
<li><strong>Too much thyroid-stimulating hormone may cause </strong>Irregular heartbeat and weight loss.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Other general signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors</strong>:</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>Nausea and vomiting.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How is a pituitary tumor diagnosed? </strong></p>
<p>Your healthcare provider may perform the following tests before<strong> pituitary tumor surgery in Delhi.</strong> These tests are:</p>
<ul>
<li>MRI</li>
<li>Blood and Urine tests to see hormonal levels</li>
<li>Eye and Neurological examination</li>
<li>Biopsy</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;">Treatment options available for Pituitary Tumor in India</span></h3>
<p>The treatment option depends on the following factors when you decide to get your tumor removal in India:</p>
<ul>
<li>The type and size of the tumor</li>
<li>If the tumor is making hormones</li>
<li>If the tumor is causing problems with vision</li>
<li>If the tumor has spread into the brain</li>
<li>If the tumor has recurred or has just been diagnosed</li>
</ul>
<p>The various treatment options to treat pituitary tumors in India are:</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Pituitary Tumor Surgery in India</strong></span></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Transsphenoidal Surgery:&nbsp;</strong></span><strong> TNTS surgery in India </strong>is a type of surgery in which instruments are inserted into the brain via an incision made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose to reach the pituitary gland. An endoscope and a curette are inserted through the nose and sphenoid bone to remove the tumor from the pituitary gland.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Endoscopic Transsphenoidal Surgery: </b><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Endoscopic pituitary tumor surgery in Delh</strong>i is a type of surgery in which an endoscope is inserted through a cut made at the back of the nose and then through the sphenoid bone to reach the pituitary gland</span><b>.</b></span> An endoscope is a thin tube-like instrument with a light to remove the tumor inside.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Craniotomy: </strong></span>It is a surgical procedure that involves opening the skull to gain access to the brain tumor.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Radiation therapy</strong></span></h2>
<p>R<strong>adiation therapy</strong> kills cancer cells or stops them from growing with high-energy X-rays. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation to the cancerous area. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Radiosurgery with stereotactic heads</strong>: A rigid frame holds the head still during treatment. Radiation is aimed directly at the tumor by a machine. The procedure doesn’t involve surgery. You can also call it stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, or radiation surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Treatment with drugs</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Pituitary tumors</strong> can be stopped from producing too many hormones with drugs.</p>
<h3><strong>Treatment with chemotherapy</strong></h3>
<p>Cancer of the pituitary gland can be treated with <strong>chemotherapy</strong> to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Chemotherapy kills or prevents cancer cells from dividing by killing or stopping them. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, it enters the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is injected directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Chemotherapy works differently depending on the type of cancer.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Endoscopic Trans-Nasal Trans-Sphenoidal Approach for Pituitary Adenomas- The Most Popular Treatment Option in India</span></h2>
<p><strong>TNTS&nbsp; surgery in India</strong> is a surgical procedure used to treat pituitary adenoma. In this procedure, the pituitary gland is reached straight via the nasal path, taking less time. It is minimally invasive, and the recovery time is quicker. Let’s dig into how this procedure is performed. It is the most popular treatment option in Indian hospitals for <strong>Pituitary Tumo</strong>r patients.</p>
<h3><strong>Before the surgery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>You will have a detailed consultation with your neurosurgeon specializing in pituitary disorders in the <strong>best hospitals for pituitary tumor surgery in India</strong>. They will order several tests to understand the size, location, and type of tumor.</li>
<li>You may also undergo additional testing to evaluate any impact on your vision.</li>
<li>If you are on any medication that affects your hormones, your healthcare provider will adjust the medications to prepare you for the surgery.</li>
<li>Since you will be placed under anesthesia during the surgery, you will have a detailed discussion with the anesthesiologist to discuss the entire plan.</li>
<li>If you have any doubts or concerns regarding the surgery, have a detailed conversation with your healthcare provider to understand<strong> transnasal&nbsp;transsphenoidal surgery in India</strong> and its implications.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Knowing the Procedure</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Anesthesia:</strong></span> You will be put under general anesthesia to ensure comfort.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Nasal Passage Access:</span> </strong>The surgeon inserts an endoscope (a thin, flexible tube with a camera) behind the nasal passages and advances it towards the sphenoid sinus. To open the front of the sinus wall, the doctor removes a small portion of the nasal septum.</li>
<li><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Sphenoid Sinus Entry:</span></strong> Once the surgeon reaches the sphenoid sinus, they cut a small hole in the bone to access the pituitary gland. This is usually done with specialized tools like drills or microdebriders.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Tumor removal: </strong></span>The surgeon uses an endoscope and other microsurgical tools like a curette to remove the pituitary adenoma. The endoscope gives the surgeon a clear view of the surgical field and allows him to navigate the delicate structures.</li>
<li><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Surgical closure:</strong></span> Afterwards, the surgeon closes the nasal passage and sphenoid sinus incisions. The healing process might involve tissue grafts or synthetic materials.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>After the Surgery</strong></h3>
<p>After<strong> TNTS surgery,</strong> here is what you can expect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Following the<strong> pituitary tumor surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital,</strong> you will be shifted to the ICU, where healthcare professionals will monitor your vitals, pain levels, and overall condition.</li>
<li>It is normal to experience some pain and discomfort for a few days after the surgery. Communicate your pain level to your healthcare providers after the surgery.</li>
<li>Since the surgery involves accessing the pituitary gland through the nasal passage, you must care for your nose during recovery. Use saline nasal sprays and keep the nasal passage moist.</li>
<li>The <strong>pituitary tumor</strong> affects the hormone level, and the surgery aims to return the hormone levels to normal. After the surgery, your hormone levels will be monitored closely to ensure complete recovery.</li>
<li>Attend all the follow-up appointments with your doctor to assess your progress and monitor your recovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Recovery After the Surgery</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pituitary Tumor Surgery in India</strong> involves an almost negligible incision, so there is no defragmentation of the patient’s face. As a result, it offers faster recovery time. Generally, the patients leave the hospital within two days.</li>
<li>General precautions include avoiding straining, heavy lifting, and nose blowing for at least a week.</li>
<li>Aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines are prohibited up to two weeks after surgery.</li>
<li>If everything goes normal, it may take two weeks to return to a routine.</li>
</ul>

<p>Transnasal transsphenoidal surgery (TNTS) is a popular minimally invasive procedure used to remove tumors from the pituitary gland situated at the base of the skull through the nasal cavity with the help of an endoscope. The major advantages of this procedure are&nbsp; less bleeding and faster recovery. To approach the hardest brain area, otherwise requiring an open surgery (Craniotomy).</p>
<p>With world-class facilities and ultra-modern equipment, India has some of the best hospitals, with the highest success rate of TNTS surgery at one-tenth the cost of its Western counterparts. Let us know more about<strong> TNTS surgery in India</strong> and it’s associated costs.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Know Your TNTS Procedure</span></h2>
<ul>
<li>The<strong> TNTS surgery in Delhi</strong> is performed under general anesthesia.</li>
<li>Then, your surgeon prepares the nasal cavity, and with the help of the 3D image-guiding system, he inserts the endoscope.</li>
<li>A small portion of the nasal septum is removed by the doctor to widen the front of the sinus wall.</li>
<li>The surgeon may remove Sella’s tiny bone to increase the visibility further.</li>
<li>Then, with the help of the dura opening, the surgeon reaches the pituitary gland and tumor.</li>
<li>The tumor is then removed from the other nostril with the help of a special tool called a curette.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">Endoscopic Transnasal Transsphenoidal Recovery: What is it like after the surgery?&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>This procedure involves an almost negligible incision, so there is no defragmentation of the patient’s face. As a result, <strong>endoscopic transnasal transsphenoidal s</strong>urgery offers faster recovery time. Generally, the patients leave the hospital within a day or two.</p>
<p>General precautions include avoiding straining, heavy lifting, and nose blowing for at least a week. You may also be deprived of using asteroids or nasal spray. Aspirin and anti-inflammatory medicines are prohibited up to two weeks after surgery. It may take two weeks to return to a normal routine if everything goes normal.</p>

			<h2><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery In India- Rewiring the Brain</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The human brain is a complex organ that controls our thoughts, movements, and emotions. However, there are specific neurological disorders that can impair the normal functioning of the brain, which in turn causes a significant impact on the quality of life of an individual.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in India</strong> is a revolutionary treatment option for patients dealing with neurological disorders. In this specific guide, we will delve into the complete procedure and advantages of DBS, the conditions treated by it, and the risks associated with the surgery. Continue reading to learn more about this revolutionary treatment.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>What is Deep Brain Stimulation?&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in Delhi</strong>, electrodes are implanted within some regions of the brain. These electrodes produce electrical impulses that are used to treat abnormal impulses. In DBS, a pacemaker-like device controls how much stimulation is delivered to the brain, placed under the skin in the chest. DBS is used to treat people whose neurons are not working correctly. <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation</strong> makes these neurons active and thus helps to improve the symptoms of various brain conditions. The DBS System involves three main components:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b><i>An electrode, </i></b><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">or lead, is a thin insulated wire implanted through an opening in the skull.</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b><i>The extension wire</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, passed under the head, neck, and shoulder skin, connects the electrode to the internal pulse generator.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b><i>The IPG ( Implantable Pulse Generator)</i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the third piece of the DBS system implanted under the upper chest’s skin.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Conditions Treated By Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in India</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Parkinson’s disease: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS eases tremors and improves motor function by modulating neural circuits that control movement.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Essential Tremors</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: An Essential Tremor is an involuntary shaking of your hands, head, or voice caused by a neurological disorder. <strong>Deep brain stimulation</strong> can help patients with essential tremors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Dystonia</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: It’s when your muscles contract involuntarily, causing you to twist or repeat motions.<strong> Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital&nbsp;</strong> relieves dystonia by normalizing muscle contractions and improving motor control.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>OCD</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery can help treat severe and treatment-resistant OCD. Using DBS, you can improve overall function and quality of life by targeting specific brain circuits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Epilepsy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: <strong>Deep Brain Stimulation</strong> is being explored as a potential epilepsy treatment, especially for people who don’t respond to traditional treatments. It reduces the frequency and severity of seizures by modulating brain activity.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Symptoms of the diseases treated by Deep Brain Stimulation Surgery</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients may experience a variety of symptoms. The most common ones are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dystonia – Involuntary Muscle Contractions</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epilepsy – Uncontrollable jerking movements of arms and legs</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential Tremor – Essential Tremor is an involuntary shaking of your hands, head</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obsessive-compulsive disorders&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parkinson’s</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Testing and Diagnosis Before the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patients with <strong>Parkinson’s disease</strong> have to undergo testing of motor functions on and off to determine the severity of their disease. <strong>Epilepsy testing</strong> includes electroencephalography, whereas patients suffering from OCD have to undergo Yale-Brown Obsessive Scale Testing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Some other tests may include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blood and Urine Tests</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRI and CT Scans of the brain&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Deep Brain Surgery In India for Treating Parkinson’s: Understanding Everything in Detail</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Before the Surgery</b></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before the surgery, your neurosurgeon will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the DBS device that has to be implanted in the brain.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will have to undergo a series of MRI and CT scans to determine the best location for placing wires for the device.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must stop taking medications before the surgery if you are on non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or blood thinners.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your neurosurgeon will ask you to wash your skin and hair with Hibiclens to avoid any infection before the <strong>deep brain stimulation surgery in Delhi.</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Including your Parkinson’s medicine, no food or drink will be allowed after midnight.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure you get plenty of sleep. DBS is a long procedure. Make sure to get enough rest for favourable outcomes.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>During the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><b>Step 1: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This procedure begins with attaching a frame to the head. The frame will be attached to your head with velcro straps. The four pin sites will be injected with local anesthesia to reduce discomfort.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Step 2: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">An MRI or CT scan is performed in this step. A box-shaped device is placed on top of the frame. Markers in the box help pinpoint the exact three-dimensional coordinates of the target on the scan. The <strong>best doctors for DBS Surgery in India</strong> use MRI / CT scans and special computer software to plan the electrode trajectory.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 3: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will then be taken to the operating room. You will lie on the table with a stereotactic frame on the head. You will remain awake during the surgery with light sedation to help you feel comfortable. A skin incision will be made across your head to expose the skull. Two quarter-size burr holes will be made on the left and right sides of the skull using the drill, allowing electrodes to pass through the brain.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Step 4: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Electrodes are inserted through a small hole into the brain. Based on the MRI and CT scan calculations, they are inserted into a precise location. The placement accuracy is based on the number of tests where you will be asked to lift your arms, and legs. An electrode records the brain’s activity and displays the waveforms on a computer. It’s the longest part of the process. It has to be repeated on both sides of the brain. The surgical team can do their job with your patience and cooperation.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 5: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the exact nerve cells are located, the surgeon will replace the electrode with a permanent DBS electrode.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Step 6: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">When the surgical team is satisfied with the electrode placement, a plastic cap is placed over the burr hole to keep the lead in place. A coil wire is left under the scalp for the later procedure. The incision is then closed with sutures.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>After The Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be kept overnight for observation and monitoring. Patients are usually discharged the next day.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After implanting the electrodes, you might feel better than usual. Brain swelling around the electrode tip can last several days to weeks.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">After about a week, you’ll have outpatient surgery to implant the stimulator in your chest/abdomen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;You’ll be under anesthesia for about an hour during this surgery. You can go home the same day.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Step 7: T</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">his step happens a week after the first&nbsp; <strong>DBS surgery in India</strong>. A small incision is made under the collarbone, and a neurotransmitter is planted under the skin. An extension wire connects the lead to the stimulator/battery in the chest or abdomen under the scalp. The device will appear as a small bulge under the skin, but it’s usually not visible under clothes. Incisions take 6-8 weeks to heal, so you can’t lift anything. Follow the discharge instructions and do the neck exercises. You can take medication to ease the pain of an incision.</span></p>
<p><b>Step 8: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll be scheduled for an OPD visit 10 days after surgery. The simulator will be programmed, and your medication dose will be adjusted. You might have to stop taking your meds for 12 hours before programming. You’ll help determine the best program to control your symptoms during the appointment. Make sure you bring your remote and charger to every appointment. It usually takes 3 to 4 visits to tweak the program settings for the best results.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Individuals may sometimes experience a brief tingling sensation when the stimulator is turned on for the first time. It’s important to keep in mind that Parkinson’s is a progressive disease and that symptoms tend to worsen over time. You must visit the neurologist’s office regularly to adjust the stimulation settings.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Results of the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For Parkinson’s, the success rate of<strong> Deep Brain Stimulation surgery in India</strong> is 70 %. It has improved many patients’ slowness, tremors, and rigidity symptoms. It has helped people to get off medicines and lessen their side effects.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DBS has reduced hand tremors in about 60 to 90 % of people for essential tremors.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">For people suffering from dystonia, DBS has proved to be the most effective treatment option.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many patients have reported improvement in the quality of their lives after DBS surgery.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>What is it like living with a Stimulator?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The handheld controller allows you to turn your stimulator on and off and adjust the strength of the stimulation. Most people keep their stimulators on the whole day. Some patients with essential tremors can use it during the day and turn it off at night. You can adjust the settings with the help of your doctor.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll need a charging unit if your DBS has a rechargeable battery. Charging takes about an hour to two hours a week on average. Other devices like cell phones, pagers, microwaves, security doors, or anti-theft sensors won’t affect your stimulator. Ensure you carry your Implanted Device Identification card when flying since airport security detects them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The battery lasts for 10 to 15 years. Once the battery wears out, it can be replaced with a new battery. The procedure is performed under anesthesia. The new battery is placed in the same location.</span></p>

			<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Breaking Barriers, Saving Lives: The Impact of Burr Hole Surgery in India</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Burr hole surgery in India</strong> is a type of neurosurgery used to treat various disorders involving the brain, skull, and other structures. To reach the underlying tissues, relieve pressure, or remove aberrant growths, a tiny hole must be made in the skull, generally using a specialized drill called a burr.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our brain is protected by a layer of thin tissues known as meninges. These meninges have blood vessels to carry blood to and from the brain. The dura is the outermost covering of the brain. Any head injury can cause these blood vessels to tear and bleed. As a result, blood might start building up in the dura matter, leading to subdural hematoma.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This buildup is dangerous and can cause death. However, this condition can be easily treated using <strong>burr hole surgery in&nbsp; Delhi</strong>, India. In this blog, we will delve into how a Burr hole Surgery is performed and the benefits of getting it done from India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Burr Hole Surgery in India: When is it required?&nbsp;</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most common reasons burr holes are needed is a subdural hematoma. Since the veins in the brain are fragile and easy to break, a hematoma can lead to symptoms like headaches, seizures, and one-sided muscle weakness.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Other reasons why you may need a burr hole surgery in India are:</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chronic Subdural Hematoma</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Epidural hematoma</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain cancer</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pus around meninges</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydrocephalus</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brain bleeds</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burr holes are the first step to bigger, more complicated brain surgeries. Surgery on the brain requires access to soft tissue underneath the skull. <strong>Burr hole surgery in Delhi</strong> allows surgeons to guide their instruments into your brain carefully. Burr holes can be made at different spots on your skull so surgeons can reach a wider brain area. While putting a burr hole in the skull is delicate, it’s relatively easy.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Burr Hole Surgery in India: Understanding its different types</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Burr hole surgery includes several different methods that are used to treat a variety of neurological problems. Each kind of burr hole surgery necessitates meticulous preparation, imaging guidance, and expert surgical methods. Many factors, like conditions being treated, surgical objectives, patient conditions, etc., play an important role in determining the treatment to be used. Let’s get deeper into a few of the most common types of burr hole surgery:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Burr Hole Craniostomy:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> During this procedure, one or more burr holes are made in the skull to reach the brain. It is frequently used to treat s<strong>ubdural hematoma</strong>, where blood builds between the dura and the brain’s protective covering. The surgeon can release pressure on the brain by draining the hematoma through the burr hole.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Stereotactic Burr Hole Biopsy: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This <strong>burr hole surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital</strong> treats brain tumors. In this method, the placement of the burr hole is accurately guided by high-tech imaging techniques like computed tomography (C.T.) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A biopsy needle is injected into the brain through the burr hole to retrieve a tissue sample for pathological investigation, which helps diagnose and select the best treatment for <strong>brain tumors.</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Ventriculostomy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A drainage tube is inserted into the brain’s ventricular system during the burr hole procedure called <strong>ventriculostomy.</strong> This method is typically used to treat disorders like hydrocephalus, in which the ventricles of the brain experience an abnormal buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The burr hole allows insertion of the drainage tube, which relieves pressure by allowing the extra CSF to be reabsorbed and rerouted.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: <strong>DBS</strong> is a neurosurgical technique that inserts electrodes deep inside particular brain parts via burr holes. DBS is used to treat neurological disorders like<strong> Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Burr Hole Surgery in India-Understanding the Complete Process</b></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Before the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your healthcare professional will perform a thorough medical evaluation before the surgery. Your medical history must be completely and accurately disclosed, including any pre-existing diseases, allergies, medications, and past procedures.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make sure to disclose all your medications to your neurosurgeon before the <strong>burr hole surgery in Delhi</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Observe your surgeon’s pre-operative fasting recommendations. To reduce the danger of aspiration during anesthesia, you will typically be requested to refrain from eating or drinking for a specified amount of time before the procedure.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must undergo a series of tests to determine your blood clotting capacity, general health, and any underlying medical disorder.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is advised to cut back or stop smoking and drinking before surgery if you do either. Alcohol and smoking can affect the healing of your wounds and how well anesthesia and medications work.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your surgeon will review the procedure’s risks, advantages, and potential side effects with you before the operation. You must understand the potential risks that can occur during the procedure.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>During the Burr Hole Surgery in India</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>best doctors for Burr Hole Surgery in India</strong>, first of all, analyze where exactly burr holes need to go. For this, they use diagnostic image testing to determine the condition you are suffering from. Once the location of the Burr hole is decided, the procedure is performed as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be given anesthesia during the procedure to not to feel any pain.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The area that needs a burr hole will then be shaved and disinfected. The hair will be removed to wipe the skin with the sterile solution to minimize the risk of infection.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will then insert additional anesthesia in the skull so you do not feel anything.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will then incision the scalp to expose the skull.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will insert the burr hole in the skin using a special drill. The hole may be used to drain the fluid that is causing pressure in the brain.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the<strong> burr hole surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital</strong> is complete, you will be shifted to the recovery room. The hospital stay can last a couple of days to ensure your vitals are okay.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>After the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s crucial to take good care of the surgical incision. Keep the incision site tidy and dry per your healthcare provider’s instructions.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Follow your surgeon’s instructions when taking prescribed drugs. To treat discomfort following surgery, this may also include antibiotics to avoid infection. Follow the recommended dosage and schedule, and let your doctor know if you have any negative reactions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rest is essential for a speedy recovery. Avoid demanding tasks, hard lifting, and high physical activity during the early healing time.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can lessen swelling and encourage drainage by keeping your head elevated, especially while you sleep. For the first several days following surgery, try to avoid lying flat by using pillows or a recliner to support yourself.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pay close attention to any infections or problems, such as pain, edema, redness, discharge, or fever. Inform your healthcare provider right away of any worries.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Attend every one of your surgeon’s scheduled follow-up appointments. These visits are essential for tracking your development, removing stitches or staples as necessary, and answering any queries or concerns you may have.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Learning the Benefits of Burr Hole Surgery&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Burr hole surgery in India</strong> is a valuable method in neurosurgery due to its numerous benefits. Let’s explore the benefits in greater detail:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Minimally Invasive:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong> Burr hole surgery in Delhi</strong> has several important benefits, one of which is that it is minimally invasive. Burr hole operations include making small incisions in the skull instead of conventional open cranial surgery, minimizing tissue stress, and lowering the possibility of complications. As a result, patients experience smaller incisions, less postoperative discomfort, less blood loss, and quicker healing time frames.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Versatility</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: A variety of neurological diseases can be treated with <strong>burr hole surgery</strong>. The treatment gives access to numerous parts of the brain and surrounding tissues, whether for deep brain stimulation, taking a brain tumor biopsy, or draining a chronic subdural hematoma.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Precise Targeting</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Burr hole surgery combines cutting-edge imaging techniques like MRI and C.T. scans. These imaging methods give surgeons precise anatomical information so they may precisely target the injured area.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Shorter Hospital Stay</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Burr hole surgery frequently results in shorter hospital stays due to its minimally invasive nature and quicker healing durations. Patients often enjoy less postoperative pain, fewer complications, and quicker mobilization than more complex cranial procedures.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Lower Risk of Infection</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Because of the smaller incisions made during burr hole surgery, the brain, and surrounding tissues are less exposed to the outside environment. This reduces the possibility of surgical site infections, which can pose a serious risk for open cranial procedures.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which excessive brain fluid accumulates within the brain’s ventricles. CSF is a fluid that surrounds the spinal cord and the brain, providing cushioning and nourishment.</p>
<p>In a healthy human, CSF is produced in the brain’s ventricles and circulates through the ventricular system, flowing through blood and the spinal cord and then absorbed back into the blood. However, in people who suffer from Hydrocephalus, there is an imbalance between the production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid, thus leading to an increase in the size of the ventricles.</p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #008080;">Hydrocephalus is diagnosed through the following methods:</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical examination and medical history</strong>: The doctor will ask about symptoms and any relevant medical history. Physical examinations include checking for abnormal eye movements, head circumference, and bulging fontanelles (in infants).</p>
<p><strong>Diagnostic imaging</strong>: Imaging tests are essential for evaluating hydrocephalus severity. Common imaging techniques include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ultrasound</li>
<li>C.T. scan of the brain</li>
<li>MRI of the brain</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lumbar puncture (spinal tap)</strong>: This procedure can measure the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid and determine its composition. The procedure involves collecting a sample of CSF from the lower back.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Symptoms of Hydrocephalus</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The common symptoms of <strong>Hydrocephalus</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Larger head size</li>
<li>Seizures</li>
<li>Headaches</li>
<li>Excessive sleepiness</li>
<li>Poor appetite</li>
<li>Memory loss</li>
<li>Poor control and coordination</li>
<li>Impaired vision</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Treatment Options to Treat Hydrocephalus</strong></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are several treatment options available to treat Hydrocephalus. The common treatment options available in India are:</p>
<p><span style="color: #993300;"><strong><span style="color: #008080;">Shunt Placement:</span> </strong></span>It is India’s most common <strong>treatment option for Hydrocephalus</strong>. A shunt is a thin tube placed inside the brain’s ventricles to drain excessive CSF and redirect it to another body part, typically the abdomen.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>ETV: </strong></span>In cases where Hydrocephalus is caused by an obstruction in the brain’s ventricular system, ETV is performed. Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy creates a small hole in the brain’s third ventricle, allowing the CSF to flow without obstruction.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Medications: </strong></span>In certain cases, medications can be prescribed to manage the symptoms of Hydrocephalus. In certain instances, the excess fluid can be controlled using antibiotics.</p>
<p>However, the most effective procedure for people dealing with Hydrocephalus is the<strong> V.P. shunt surgery in Delhi</strong>. It reduces complications and promises a healthy life to people with this critical condition.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;">VP Shunt Surgery in India: Know the Surgery in Detail</span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Before the Surgery: </strong></span></h3>
<p><strong><em>Several steps are taken before the surgery to achieve optimal results. These steps are:</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Medical Evaluation: </strong>Your neurosurgeon will complete a physical evaluation to know your symptoms and medical history. This examination determines if you are a perfect candidate for the surgery<strong>. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Pre-operative assessment: </strong>Before <strong>VP Shunt Surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hospital,</strong> you will likely undergo a preoperative assessment to evaluate your overall health. This includes blood tests, ECG, and other medical tests based on your medical history.</li>
<li><strong>Risks and benefits: </strong>Before the surgery, a complete discussion will occur between you and your healthcare team regarding the risks and benefits associated with the surgery. Knowing the potential complications before the surgery is crucial to be ready for the</li>
<li><strong>Preparing for the surgery: </strong>You may be given specific instructions before the surgery, like quitting alcohol, smoking, and fasting. You will also be instructed to stop certain medications that can hinder the outcomes of the surgery.</li>
<li><strong>Anaesthesia Consultation: </strong>You will meet your anesthesia team before the <strong>VP Shunt Surgery in India</strong>. They will review your medical history to ensure you do not suffer any complications during the surgery.</li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>V.P. Shunt Surgery India: Know How it is D</strong><b>one?</b></span></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The doctors place the V.P. shunt under general anesthesia. Usually, the entire procedure takes about 90 minutes. The whole procedure of placing the V.P. shunt is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The surgery begins by making a tiny incision behind the ear. The surgeon also makes a small hole in the skull using a drill.</li>
<li>The <strong>best doctor for VP Shunt surgery in India</strong>&nbsp;will then insert a catheter into one of the brain’s ventricles, and the other catheter is passed down into the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li>A one-way valve is placed along the catheter under the skin. This valve helps regulate fluid flow from the brain to the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li>The two catheters are connected, and a small tunnel is created under the skin to allow the fluid to flow from the brain to the abdominal cavity.</li>
<li>The abdominal end of the catheter is placed within the peritoneal cavity, which is a space within the abdomen.</li>
<li>The incisions are then closed, and the entire area is bandaged.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Overcoming Challenges and Embracing Healing: The Road to Recovery</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>You must know several things about the recovery process after <strong>ventriculoperitoneal (V.P.) shunt surgery in India</strong>. The recovery period looks like this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay in the hospital: </strong>Patients stay there for a few days for close monitoring after surgery. During this time, the healthcare team will monitor the patient’s vital signs, how the shunt works, and manage pain.</li>
<li><strong>Incision Care: </strong>Ensuring the incision sites are clean is crucial to a quick recovery. After<strong> VP Shunt Surgery,</strong> patients are instructed to keep the incision clean and dry<strong>.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Pain Management: </strong>Patients may experience discomfort or pain during surgery at incision sites. To manage the discomfort, pain medications will be prescribed. Be sure to take the medication as directed and tell your doctor if your pain worsens.</li>
<li><strong>Physical Activity and Restriction: </strong>Patients will get guidelines on physical activity and restrictions during recovery. Remember these instructions to prevent straining the surgical site and ensure it heals properly. Initially, the doctor may restrict activities, but patients can slowly resume normal activities.</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring and follow-up appointments: </strong>Patients are scheduled for regular follow-up appointments to check on the shunt and make any necessary adjustments. A CT scan or X-ray may evaluate a shunt’s positioning and effectiveness.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Precautions After the&nbsp; VP Shunt Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>It is crucial to take the following precautions after the surgery to ensure proper recovery and minimize the risk of complications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Take proper care of the incision. Keep it clean and dry.</li>
<li>Avoid strenuous exercise as it can put a strain on the surgical site. Increase your activity levels gradually.</li>
<li>Monitor your shunt function regularly. Immediately report any abnormal symptoms like headaches, irritability, and vomiting to your healthcare provider.</li>
<li>Take prescribed medicines on time to prevent any kind of infection and effective management of pain after <strong>VP Shunt surgery in Delhi.</strong></li>
<li>Practice good hygiene to avoid any infection at the surgical site.</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Advantages of V.P. Shunt Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>There are several advantages of <strong>V.P. shunt surgery in India.</strong> These advantages include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Treatment for Hydrocephalus:</strong> The <strong>V.P. shunt surgery</strong> is well-established and effective. The procedure allows excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to be diverted from the brain’s ventricles and absorbed elsewhere, reducing hydrocephalus symptoms and relieving pressure on the brain.</li>
<li><strong>Reduces symptoms and improves the quality of life</strong>: <strong>V.P. shunt surgery</strong> reduces the pressure in the brain caused by the accumulation of CSF. As a result, the patient’s quality of life can be enhanced, and they’ll be able to function better daily.</li>
<li><strong>Long-term&nbsp;</strong><b>management</b>. Shunt surgery handles Hydrocephalus for a long time. The shunt system drains CSF and prevents fluid buildup, so there’s less risk of complications and repeat invasive procedures.</li>
<li><strong>Customized treatment</strong>: V.P. shunt surgeries can be tailored to patients’ needs. A shunt system can be adjusted or revised to manage patient condition changes over time and optimize CSF drainage. As a result, Hydrocephalus can be managed in a personalized, ongoing way.</li>
<li><strong>A minimally invasive surgery</strong>: <strong>V.P. shunt surgery</strong> is a surgery, but it’s generally considered a minimally invasive procedure compared to other neurosurgical procedures. In most cases, the procedure involves small incisions and endoscopic techniques. With minimally invasive procedures, tissues are less traumatized, hospital stays are shorter, and recovery is faster.</li>
<li><strong>Wide availability</strong>: <strong>V.P. shunt surgery in India</strong> is widely available in hospitals and medical centers. Neurosurgeons and healthcare teams perform these surgeries so patients get quality care and get the best results.</li>

<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>VP Shunt Surgery in India: Factors Affecting the Cost</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A <strong>VP shunt surgery</strong> is a procedure that is performed to treat Hydrocephalus. It is a condition caused by the accumulation of Cerebrospinal fluid in the brain’s ventricles. During the procedure, a thin tube called a shunt is implanted into the brain’s ventricles to divert the fluid from the brain to other body parts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>VP shunt surgery cost in India</strong> depends on various factors. Let us know these factors one by one:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Hospital Quality Accreditation: The </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">hospital’s choice and infrastructure significantly impact the cost. Well-established JCI-accredited hospitals charge more, like Indraprastha Apollo Hospital and Medanta Hospital.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Type of hospital you choose: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>cost of VP Shunt surgery in Delhi</strong> will also depend on the type of hospital you choose. The costs will be higher if the hospital is a super-specialty or a single super-specialist. The hospital’s brand also plays a key role in deciding the cost. For example, I<strong>ndraprastha Apollo Hospital and Fortis Hospital</strong> will charge you more for VP shunt surgery in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Surgeons Fee: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost will be more if you get the procedure done by an experienced neurosurgeon. The surgeons who use the latest technology to perform the procedure and have low mortality and low morbidity rates generally charge high. A highly qualified, experienced, and internationally trained surgeon tends to charge more for the same surgery.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Technology and Equipment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>cost of VP shunt surgery</strong> also depends on the technology and equipment quality, since they play a major role in deciding the surgical outcomes. Hospitals using advanced tools like robotics, stereotactic, or neuronavigation will charge you more.</span></p>
<p><b>Diagnostic Tests: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-operative diagnostic tests like MRI scans or any other special tests the surgeon suggests also add to the overall <strong>cost of VP Shunt surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><b>Duration of Hospital Stay: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of hospital stay also adds to the overall cost of the surgery. Complications or needing to stay longer in the hospital increases the overall cost. Also, the category of the room you choose for your hospital stay determines the cost.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Medications: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cost of medicines, surgery supplies, and other things also contribute to the cost of VP Shunt surgery. Also, if you choose an American device for the surgery, the cost will be higher than an Indian device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Complications: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case of complications, you may need extra days of hospitalization and more medicines, leading to increased costs.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Comorbidity – </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Co-morbidity is the presence of any other medical condition alongside the condition that is being treated. Co-morbidities complicate the procedure and collectively increase the surgical costs, long hospital stays, more medicines, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>Location of the Hospital: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location of the hospital also determines the<strong> cost of VP Shunt surgery in Delhi.</strong> The cost will increase if the hospital is located in metropolitan cities in India like Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore.&nbsp;</span></p>

			<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>AVM Surgery in India: Your Health, Our Priority</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An arteriovenous malformation is an abnormal tangle of blood vessels that connect arteries and veins in the brain. The arteries carry oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the brain, whereas veins carry oxygen-depleted blood from the heart to the lungs. For people who suffer from AVM, this normal process is disrupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cause of AVM is still not clear. Many people have it from birth, while some develop it later in life. In this article, we will delve into the surgical options available for the <strong>treatment of AVM in India</strong> and we will also look into how you can access the best AVM surgery in India. Please continue reading to learn everything about AVM and its treatment in India.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><strong>Arteriovenous Malformation Surgery in Delhi: Lets know the symptoms&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The signs and symptoms of AVM do not appear until it ruptures, resulting in brain hemorrhage. Some people may also experience other symptoms like:&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Seizures</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Headache</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Muscle weakness</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Weakness or paralysis</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vision loss</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Difficulty in speaking</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Unsteadiness</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Some important facts you should know about AVM</b></span></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, the symptoms of AVM start appearing between ages 10 to 40. AVM damages brain tissues slowly, and symptoms appear in early adulthood.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVMs become stable in middle age.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most severe AVM involves a vein of Galen. It causes major symptoms that appear after birth. The vessel causes an accumulation of fluid in the brain leading to swelling in the brain.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>AVM Surgery in India: Understanding the Causes</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">AVMs have an unknown cause. The majority of brain AVMs form during fetal development. However, they can also develop after birth. People with <strong>Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome</strong>, or <strong>hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia</strong> (HHT), may develop brain AVMs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In arteries, blood flows through increasingly smaller vessels, ending in capillaries, which slow blood flow. Capillaries deliver oxygen to surrounding brain tissue through their thin, porous walls. The oxygen-depleted blood passes through small blood vessels and into larger veins to replenish oxygen. In an AVM, the arteries and veins lack this network of smaller blood vessels. As a result, blood bypasses surrounding tissues by flowing directly from arteries to veins. To correct this defect, you need <strong>arteriovenous malformation surgery</strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Why is it necessary to treat the brain AVM?</b></span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since AVMs put extreme pressure on the walls of the arteries and veins, there are chances of life-threatening bleeding. Hence it is essential to have<strong> arteriovenous malformation surgery in India,</strong> to treat the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The blood does not flow through capillaries in people with brain AVM. Instead flows directly from arteries to veins. As a result, surrounding brain tissues cannot absorb oxygen due to the fast speed of the blood. Without sufficient oxygen, brain tissues die hence leading to a stroke.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some AVMs are big, and they compress certain portions of the brain. This can even lead to brain damage.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><b>How are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) diagnosed?</b></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>&nbsp;Best doctors for AVN surgery in India</strong>, will order some imaging tests to detect AVM. These tests include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MRA ( Cerebral magnetic resonance angiography)</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CTA ( Computed tomography angiography )</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Transcranial Doppler Ultrasound</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Treatment Options available in India to treat AVM</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Treatment choice depends on the location, type, and size of AVM. Treating this condition as soon as possible is the best way to avoid serious complications. The various treatment options available are:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="color: #000000;"><b>Surgery: </b></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Doctors make a small incision near the AVM, sealing the surrounding veins and arteries. This doesn’t let them bleed. Through <strong>AVM Surgery in India,</strong> the blood flow is directed to normal blood vessels.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Embolization: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">During this procedure, a catheter gets inserted into an artery in your groin and moves to the AVM location. After that, a glue-like substance, coils, or another substance is injected into the AVM to slow or stop blood flow. Usually, this approach is used when the AVMs are big and have a lot of blood flowing through them.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Gamma Knife Surgery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this method, highly focused radiation beams dissolve AVM and make it easier to remove via surgery.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Embolization Surgery in India: Understanding the most popular treatment option in detail</b></span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization is a minimally invasive procedure to <strong>treat AVM in India</strong>. It blocks or reduces the blood flow to the abnormal blood vessels. Let us understand everything about it in detail.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Before the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You may be asked to undergo a series of medical exams like an MRI, CT scan, and angiogram. This helps to determine the size and location of AVM.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will meet with an interventional radiologist to discuss the embolization procedure’s risks and benefits.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You must follow certain instructions before the surgery, like fasting before the procedure and avoiding smoking, alcohol, and blood thinning medications.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will also undergo certain tests like kidney function, heart function, liver function, and blood clotting time to determine whether you are a suitable candidate for the <strong>embolization surgery in India.&nbsp;</strong></span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the procedure requires anesthesia, you will also have a detailed meeting with the anesthesiologist to determine anesthesia options.</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>During the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Anesthesia: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The <strong>AVM Surgery in Indraprastha Apollo Hopsital</strong> begins with giving a local anesthetic to the place where the catheter has to be inserted. In some cases, general anesthesia is given too.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Catheter Insertion: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">The surgeon will insert a small flexible catheter into a blood vessel in the groin area. This is done using real-time X-Ray guidance. The catheter is taken to the location of the abnormality.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Angiography: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the catheter is in the right place, a dye is inserted, and X-Ray images are taken to visualize the area of abnormality.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Embolization Material Delivery: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the target area is identified, the embolic material is delivered through the catheter to block blood flow. The material can be tiny particles, glue-like substances, coils, or liquids. The choice depends on the area to be targeted.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><b>Follow-Up Angiography: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once the embolic material is in place, additional angiography is done to determine its effectiveness. It is done to ensure that AVM is shrinking.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>After the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Depending on your condition, you will be transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A physician will closely monitor your vital signs to detect immediate complications or changes in your condition after <strong>&nbsp;arteriovenous malformation surgery in India</strong>.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pain medications or other appropriate pain management techniques are prescribed during recovery to ensure your comfort.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You will be observed for complications, such as bleeding, infection, or adverse reactions to medications.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Recovery time depends on the specific condition treated and the patient’s individual response.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">An angiography or CT scan may be performed to confirm that the embolization is effective and blood flow to the target area has reduced.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The length of the hospital stay depends on the procedure and your condition. Some people are discharged on the same day, while others need more recovery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">You and your caregivers will receive specific discharge instructions regarding wound care, medication management, physical activity limitations, and any required follow-up appointments. You must follow these instructions closely to promote healing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Embolization</strong> is followed up by regular follow-up appointments to assess long-term effectiveness. Follow-up visits will depend on each case and how the healthcare team recommends t</span><b>hem.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Knowing More About Coil Used During the Surgery</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bare platinum coils are made of biocompatible platinum alloy with no additional covering or coating. It is a non-reactive material that is well-suited for use in the human body. The coil’s size and shape primarily depend upon the location of the abnormality of the AVM. At the same time, its diameter ranges from 0.015 inches to 0.038 inches. These coils may last up to 20 years after the , <strong>arteriovenous malformation surgery in Delhi.</strong></span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><b>Advantages of Embolization</b></span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Embolization</strong> has several advantages. Let’s look at them:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a minimally invasive procedure requiring less extensive surgery than other surgical options. Hence it involves fewer scars and faster recovery time.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is used to treat AVM by targeting abnormal blood vessels. Hence the surrounding tissues are preserved.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization can reduce the blood flow to abnormal blood vessels. It prevents complications caused by AVM by introducing embolic materials to block the blood vessels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization can be customized to meet individual needs. An interventional radiologist or surgeon can adjust the type and amount of embolic material used to target specific blood vessels.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embolization may be used in conjunction with other treatments. It can be performed before surgery to reduce tumor size or AVM, making surgery easier and safer.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Embolization surgery in India</strong> can often be performed as an outpatient procedure or with a short stay in the hospital. Patients can return to their normal activities faster, and healthcare costs are reduced.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The risk of complications associated with embolization generally is lower than that of open surgery.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The embolization procedure can be repeated if necessary. When embolization does not completely resolve the condition in a single procedure, the procedure can be repeated to further control blood flow.</span></li>

			<h2><a name="_3tpsqzpfxc07"></a><span lang="EN" style="color: #008080;">Brain Aneurysm surgery in India: Hope and Healing</span></h2>
<p>Brain aneurysm surgery is a complex procedure to treat a potentially life-threatening brain condition. An aneurysm is a bulge or balloon-like development that forms when a weak area in the wall of a blood artery in the brain grows.</p>
<p>Untreated aneurysms can potentially burst, resulting in brain hemorrhage, a stroke, or even death. To treat or stop an aneurysm from rupturing, surgery is frequently advised. During this treatment, trained neurosurgeons carefully maneuver the complex network of blood vessels in the brain to fix the aneurysm and restore normal blood flow.</p>
<p>The success rates of brain aneurysm surgeries have significantly increased thanks to developments in medical technology and surgical methods.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Types of Brain Aneurysm</strong></span></h3>
<p>The various types of brain aneurysms are:<br>
● <strong>Saccular Aneurysm:</strong> This type of aneurysm is a round sac-like structure filled with blood from a main artery or one of its branches. It is the most common type of aneurysm.<br>
● <strong>Fusiform Aneurysm:</strong> This type causes bulging on all sides of the artery.<br>
● <strong>Mycotic Aneurysm:</strong> Mycotic aneurysm is caused by an infection that affects arteries in the brain. The infection weakens the wall of the arteries, which causes the aneurysm to form.</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What happens if a brain aneurysm ruptures?</strong></span></p>
<p>There are lots of health problems that can happen if a brain aneurysm ruptures, like:<br>
● Bleeding in the thin tissues covering and protecting the brain (the arachnoid layer).<br>
● Hemorrhagic stroke</p>
<p><strong>It can result in permanent brain damage or other complications, like:</strong></p>
<p>● <strong>Vasospasm:</strong> When blood vessels narrow or shut down, less oxygen gets to the brain.<br>
● <strong>Hydrocephalus:</strong> In hydrocephalus, your brain is under a lot of pressure due to blood or cerebrospinal fluid buildup.<br>
● Convulsions<br>
● Coma<br>
● Death</p>

<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>What are the causes of brain aneurysms?</strong></span></p>
<p>Aneurysms develop on the walls of an artery when the brain becomes weak or thin. Sometimes people are born with aneurysms due to a congenital disability. Several other factors that cause aneurysms are:<br>
● Marfan syndrome<br>
● Fibromuscular dysplasia<br>
● Arteriovenous malformation<br>
● Polycystic kidney disease</p>
<p><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Diagnosis of Brain Aneurysm</strong></span><br>
● MRI &amp; CT Scan brain<br>
● Angiogram<br>
● Transcranial Doppler<br>
● Cerebral Angiography</p>
<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Understanding Brain Aneurysm Surgery in Detail: The Endovascular Coiling Surgery</strong></span></h2>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Before the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>● A comprehensive assessment by a neurosurgeon is required to assess the overall health condition, the nature of the aneurysm, and any potential risks or complications associated with the surgery.<br>
● The medical team will examine your medical background, including any pre-existing diseases, allergies, or prior surgeries.<br>
● You may undergo preoperative blood tests to assess the blood count, clotting capacity, and general health.<br>
● Before surgery, it may be necessary to temporarily stop using or change the dosage of some medications, such as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. This lowers the possibility of significant bleeding occurring during the surgery.<br>
● It is crucial to follow the instructions provided by the medical team regarding medication management.<br>
● Before surgery, you may be told to fast for a specific time. This will ensure that you remain empty stomach throughout the procedure, lowering the risk of aspiration and anesthesia-related problems.<br>
● It is advised for patients who smoke to give up smoking before surgery. Smoking can reduce blood flow and raise the possibility of problems.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>During the surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>● This procedure is carried out in the DSA lab under local anesthesia. An expert interventional Radiologist is needed for the aneurysm coiling procedure.<br>
● You’ll be given a hospital gown and asked to remove any clothing, jewelry, or other items at the start of the treatment. Once done, the nurse will ask you to lie backward on the X-ray table.<br>
● Then the intravenous line (IV) tube will be placed inside a vein of your hand or arm. Afterward, an electrocardiogram will be connected to monitor the heart’s electrical activity.<br>
● After cleaning the injection site, mainly the groin, the nurse injects the local anesthesia.<br>
● Then the surgeon will make a small incision to insert a catheter into the artery through the blood vessel. This catheter is guided by fluoroscopy to reach the affected artery in the brain.<br>
● To measure the shape and size of the aneurysm, the surgeon will inject contrast dye in and around the surrounding blood vessels.<br>
● Next, the surgeon inserts a smaller catheter into the central catheter. Once this small catheter reaches the aneurysm, the surgeon inserts the coil until it completely seals off it.<br>
● To seal the aneurysm completely, the interventional Radiologist will insert as many coils as he needs. Within the aneurysm, the coils will form a mesh-like structure that will serve as a support.<br>
● In order to ensure that the aneurysm has been sealed off completely, additional X-ray images will need to be taken following the packing of the aneurysm with coils. As long as the coil remains in place, it will act as a permanent fix for the aneurysm.<br>
● Lastly, after stitching the incision, he will remove the catheter and apply the bandage at the operation site.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>After the Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>It is crucial to follow specific postoperative guidelines to enhance healing, avoid problems, and assist in a quick recovery after brain aneurysm surgery. Here are some standard postoperative safety measures:<br>
● After surgery, you will be moved to the ICU for intensive observation of vital signs, neurological conditions, and any complications.<br>
● Following the surgery, you are advised to avoid physical work and refrain from intense exercise. This limitation reduces the chances of bleeding, prevents stress on the surgical site, and aids in the healing process.<br>
● After brain aneurysm surgery, some level of pain or discomfort is average. The medical staff will administer a proper pain management plan, including medicines or other methods to lessen pain.<br>
● Proper care is necessary for the incision site in the scalp. You must follow the surgeon’s wound care guidelines and keep the incision area clean and dry.<br>
● The medical staff will provide guidelines for postoperative medications, including painkillers, antibiotics, and any required blood pressure medications.<br>
● After brain aneurysm surgery, scheduling frequent follow-up meetings with the neurosurgeon is critical. During these visits, the medical staff will evaluate your neurological condition, track the healing process, and handle any issues that could come up.</p>
<h3><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Benefits of Brain Aneurysm Surgery</strong></span></h3>
<p>For patients suffering from brain aneurysms, this surgery has several important advantages. These advantages consist of:</p>
<p>● Brain aneurysm surgery is primarily designed to prevent aneurysm rupture. Aneurysms can rupture, causing life-threatening diseases like stroke or subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p>
<p>● An aneurysm can rupture again and bleed again, causing severe complications. A brain aneurysm surgery fixes the aneurysm and stops further blood flow.</p>
<p>● Headaches, vision problems, and neurological abnormalities can be signs of an unruptured brain aneurysm. The surgery can relieve these problems and enable patients to live a more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>● Improved surgical methods and technology have reduced the risk of problems associated with brain aneurysm surgery.</p>
<p>● Patients who have successfully undergone brain aneurysm surgery have long-term stability.</p>
<p>● A complete recovery is possible depending on the location and size of the aneurysm.</p>
